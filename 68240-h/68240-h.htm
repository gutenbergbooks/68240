</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first knew Betty Wales she was a
freshman at Harding College, with a sedate,
comical roommate named Helen Chase Adams,
and a host of good friends, who stood by her
and one another all through the four years of
their college course. Mary Brooks&mdash;afterward
Mrs. Hinsdale&mdash;was a sophomore when
Betty entered college, but the others, the three
B’s, Roberta Lewis, Eleanor Watson, Rachel
Morrison, and Katherine Kittredge,&mdash;all belonged
to the “finest class” of 19&mdash;. So did
Madeline Ayres, though she was a year late in
joining it and felt obliged to make up for lost
time by being a particularly lively and loyal
Hardingite during her abbreviated course
there. Georgia Ames first appeared in 19&mdash;’s
junior year, and joined “The Merry Hearts,”
a society that Betty and her friends had organized.
But Georgia the first, as Madeline
used to call her, was only a figment of Madeline’s
imagination; it was a delightful coincidence when,
at the end of the year, a real
Georgia Ames appeared to step into the place
left vacant by her departed namesake, whose
short but strenuous career at Harding had
made them both famous.</p>

<p>All these things and many others may be
found in the four books entitled respectively
“Betty Wales, Freshman,” “Betty Wales,
Sophomore,” “Betty Wales, Junior,” and
“Betty Wales, Senior.” This story was written
because some of Betty’s friends were not
satisfied to leave her at the end of her senior
year, but wished to hear what she did next.
If any of them still want to know what happened
to her after she came back from her trip
abroad, why, perhaps some day they may.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN IMPROMPTU WEDDING&mdash;AND OTHER IMPROMPTUS</span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>,” announced Betty Wales to the
family breakfast table, a week after 19&mdash;’s
commencement, “I’m beginning to feel
quite at home again. I’ve got my room
fixed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So it looks as much like a Harding room
as you can make it,” laughed Nan.</p>

<p>“And you spend most of your time describing
the lost glories of Harding to anybody
who will listen,” added Will.</p>

<p>“And the rest in writing long letters to the
other ‘Merry Hearts,’” put in mother slyly.</p>

<p>“And she plans what I’ll do when I go to
college,” declared the Smallest Sister, who had
just had her first “teens birthday” and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
not propose to be excluded from any family
council.</p>

<p>“In short,” said Mr. Wales, appearing
solemnly from behind the morning paper,
“being ‘quite at home’ means wishing you
were back at college. Is that about the size
of it, Miss Betty Wales?”</p>

<p>“Never, daddy,” cried Betty, leaning across
the corner of the table to give him a hug.
“I’m just as glad as I can be to be really and
truly at home again with my family. Of
course I shall miss the girls dreadfully,
but&mdash;oh, there the postman’s ring! I wonder
if he’s got anything for me.” And Betty
danced off to the door, answering Nan’s
and Will’s chorused “I told you so!” with a
laughing “I don’t care.” As Will had once
said, “The nicest thing about Betty is that
she can’t possibly be teased.”</p>

<p>She was back in a minute with a handful
of letters for the family and four for herself.</p>

<p>“All from late lamented Hardingites?”
inquired Will, who never wrote letters and
therefore seldom got any to read over his
morning coffee.</p>

<p>Betty was tearing open the second envelope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
“That one isn’t. It’s just congratulations on
graduating, from Aunt Maria. But this is
from Madeline Ayres&mdash;why, how funny! It’s
dated Monday, in New York, and she was
going to sail last Saturday. Oh, dear, I don’t
understand at all! She says”&mdash;Betty frowned
despairingly over Madeline’s dainty, unreadable
hieroglyphics&mdash;“she says, ‘You have
heard all about it by this time, I suppose,
and isn’t it just&mdash;just&mdash;&mdash;’ Oh, I wish
Madeline could write plainly.”</p>

<p>“Too bad about these college graduates who
can neither read nor write,” said Will loftily.
“Try the next one. Perhaps they’ll explain
each other. Isn’t that scrawly one in the
blue envelope from Katherine Kittredge?”</p>

<p>Betty nodded absently and tore open the
blue envelope. “Why how funny!” she
cried. “K. begins just the very same way.
‘Of course you’ve heard about it by this time,
and isn’t it the nicest ever? Are you and
Roberta going to wear your commencement
dresses too? Wasn’t it exciting the way they
caught Madeline on the wharf? By the way,
both the straps of my telescope broke on the
way home, and so I’ve bought a gorgeous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
leather bag to carry on this trip, without waiting
for my first salary. Dick lent me the
money&mdash;you know he’s been working this
winter, so that I could stay at Harding, and
they never told me a word about it. We’re
planning for his college course now, father and
I, and I couldn’t have gone a step to the wedding
if dear old Mary hadn’t sent the ticket.’
Gracious!” interpolated Betty excitedly,
“what is she talking about? Dick’s her
brother. That hasn’t anything to do with
the rest of the letter.” She glanced at
the last envelope. “Oh, this is from Mary
Brooks. I hope it won’t be puzzle number
three.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t. Betty read it all through to
herself&mdash;four closely written pages&mdash;while the
Wales family, who had all become interested
by this time, watched her cheeks growing
pinker and her eyes brighter and bigger with
excitement, as she read. At the end she gave
a rapturous little sigh. “Oh, it’s just perfectly
lovely!” she declared.</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Will.</p>

<p>“Oh, everything,” answered Betty vaguely.
“Mary’s going to be married a week from to-day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and we’re all coming,&mdash;every single one
of us. She caught Madeline before she went
abroad, and Eleanor before she left for Denver,
and she’s sent tickets to K. and Rachel and
Helen, instead of giving us all bridesmaids’
presents. Oh, father dear, may I go?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales smiled into his daughter’s
flushed, happy face. “Betty,” he said, “your
enthusiasm is delightful. We shall miss it
while you are gone, but if Mary&mdash;whoever she
may be&mdash;is going to be married and can’t have
it done properly without you, why we shall
have to drift along for another week in our
accustomed state of staid and placid calm.”</p>

<p>And Betty was so excited and so busy explaining
to her father which one of all the
girls he met at Harding was Mary Brooks, and
which one of the faculty was Dr. Hinsdale,
that she never noticed the letter from Babbie
Hildreth, in her father’s mail, or the dainty,
scented note, also postmarked Pelham Manor,
which her mother read and covertly passed to
Nan and then to Mr. Wales. And after breakfast
she flew straight up-stairs to answer her
letters, never dreaming that the long talk
father and mother and Nan were having on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the piazza just underneath her windows was
all about her&mdash;Betty Wales&mdash;and the reasons
why she should or should not go on the
most glorious summer trip that a girl ever
took.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see,” father called back from
the gate, as he hurried off to his office at last,
and Betty smiled to herself and wondered
whether Nan wanted a set of new books or the
Smallest Sister a bicycle. “Father always
says that when he thinks you’re getting pretty
extravagant in your tastes, but still he’s going
to let you have it all the same,” reflected Betty,
and started for the third time to reread
Mary’s letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearest Betty,” it began, “I’ve left you
till the last to write to because you aren’t
going to the ends of the earth within the
week, and you don’t take ages to make
up your mind to things. In short, my
child, I know that this impromptu wedding
idea will appeal to you and that you will
keep your promise to help Roberta do the
bridesmaid act just as nicely as if I’d told you
six weeks ahead instead of one, and then sent
you a neatly engraved invitation at the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
hour and minute. We want to be married
next Thursday at three, because&mdash;oh, dear,
here comes George Garrison Hinsdale this
minute, and I promised to be ready to take
him to call on my minister. I’ll tell you why
we changed our minds when I see you. You
and Roberta and Laurie are to stay with me,
and the others are invited to Tilly Root’s, just
across the street. There’s a dinner Wednesday
night, before the rehearsal. Oh, about
clothes,&mdash;just wear your graduating dress or
anything else that you and Roberta agree
upon. Let me know your train. Oh, and
you won’t draw a present, because I wanted
all the girls to come, so I sent tickets to K.
and Rachel and Helen. I hope they won’t
feel hurt, and that you won’t mind not having
diamond sunbursts to remember the occasion
by. You see I couldn’t give diamond sunbursts
to some and railroad tickets to others.
It would have spoiled the scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you how I caught Madeline’s
coat-tails just as she was going on board
her boat, but George Garrison Hinsdale refuses
to wait another second. I foresee that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
have drawn a tyrannical husband. And the
moral of that is,&mdash;I’m too happy to care.</p>

<p><span class="right1">“Yours ever,</span><br />
<span class="smcap right2">“Mary</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Before she wrote to Mary, Betty puzzled
out most of Madeline’s letter, which gave an
amusing account of her sudden change of
plans. “Eleanor came to see me off,” she
wrote, “and Dick Blake was there with his
arms full of flowers for me and his eyes fastened
tight to Eleanor, and all the good Bohemians
were saying fond farewells and sending
messages to daddy and telling when
they’d probably turn up in Sorrento, when up
dashed Mary Brooks and her professor. And
in five minutes Dick had sold my cabin to a
man he knew who had come down on the
chance of getting one and that boat had sailed
without me and my flowers and my steamer
trunk and my ‘carry-all-and-more-too’; and
my weeping chaperon that I had not yet
wasted time in hunting up is probably sending
wireless messages of condolence to my
family this minute. But Dr. Hinsdale cabled,
and then Dick took the whole crowd to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
roof-garden to cool off, and after that he and
I went down the Bowery giving away that
armful of roses to the smallest, raggedest children
we could find. So it was a very nice
party, and of course I can go to Italy any
time.<span class="smcap right3">Mad.</span>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this is how it happened that just two
weeks after they had parted, bravely trying
not to show that they cared, “The Merry
Hearts,”&mdash;or at least the Chapin House division
of them, with the B’s thrown in for full
measure,&mdash;met, one sultry July afternoon, on
Mary’s big, vine-shaded piazza and, chattering
like magpies, drank inordinate quantities of
lemonade and iced tea and heard from the
bride-to-be all the whys and wherefores of her
impromptu wedding.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told any of you why we
changed?” asked Mary. “No, Babe, it wasn’t
because we hadn’t the strength of mind to
wait till August. It was because my Uncle
Marcellus gave us a desert island up on the
Maine Coast for a wedding present. Roberta,
pass the cookies to yourself, please.”</p>

<p>“Query,” propounded K. gaily. “When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
given a desert island for a wedding present is
it obligatory to take possession instantly or
forever after keep away?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish,” said Mary severely.
“It was this way, don’t you see. The island
has a gorgeous camp on it, and of course we
want to go there for our honeymoon, and why
shouldn’t we start early and stay all summer?
If we had waited until the middle of August,
as we planned, that desert island would have
gone to waste for one whole month.”</p>

<p>“Which would ill become the desert island
of a psychology professor,” declared Madeline.
“Who says that the college girl doesn’t bring
intellect to bear on the practical affairs of
life?”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” cried Bob, waving her lemonade
glass. “Here’s to the college bride,
who lets no desert island waste its sweetness
on the empty air! Here’s to the impromptu
wedding! Here’s to the first ‘Merry Heart’
reunion! Here’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, Bob,” Babbie protested. “You’re
disgracing the bridal party in the eyes of
the neighborhood. Take us up to see the
trousseau, Mary, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet there’s nothing very impromptu
about that,” declared Babe.</p>

<p>“Oh, girls, I hope you’ll like it,” began
Mary anxiously, leading the way indoors.
“I’ve positively worn myself out trying to
have it right&mdash;right for a Harding professor’s
wife, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Picture Mary looking twenty in pink
chiffon, being a patroness at the junior prom,”
cried K., picking up the small bride and
standing her in a piazza chair.</p>

<p>“Picture Mary behind an armful of violets,
sitting on the stage at the big game, trying to remember
that she’s Mrs. Professor Hinsdale and
mustn’t shriek for the purple,” added Rachel.</p>

<p>“Picture Mary in a velvet suit and a picture
hat, making her first calls on the faculty,”
jeered Bob.</p>

<p>“When she’s fairly pining to go snow-shoeing
with her little friends in the senior class,”
added Babe convincingly.</p>

<p>“Stop teasing her,” commanded Betty,
helping Mary down from her lofty perch.
“She’ll be the nicest professor’s wife that ever
was&mdash;see if she isn’t! Now come and label
her dresses for the proper occasions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>It was most absorbing&mdash;deciding what Mary
should wear to faculty parties, to college lectures,
to the president’s dinners&mdash;“Just to
think of being invited to dinner at Prexie’s!”
said little Helen Adams in awed tones&mdash;“to
house plays, to senior dramatics, and to all
the other important functions of the college
year.” It took a long time, too, because of
course such delicate questions couldn’t be decided
without seeing Mary in each dress, and
getting “the exact combination of youth,
beauty, and dignity that resulted,” as K., who
explained that she was practising “school-ma’am
English,” put it.</p>

<p>And then there were so many digressions.
It was only two weeks since they had separated
at Harding, but in the meanwhile a great deal
seemed to have happened. Helen had accepted
a position to teach English in her home
high school. Eleanor was to join her family
after the wedding for a hastily planned trip
through the Canadian Rockies. Most exciting
of all, Bob had actually established her
fresh-air colony.</p>

<p>“It’s great,” she declared. “When I asked
father if I might have some slum children out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
for two weeks he thought I was joking, so he
said yes, and when those six dirty little ragamuffins
suddenly dawned upon his vision last
Saturday night he was furious. But I coaxed
a little, and I got him to give the boys a
Fourth of July oration, and when Jimmie
Scheverin hopped up and solemnly thanked
him for his unique and inspiring address, he
gave in. He’s staying at home now to look
after things while I’m gone. He said he
guessed Wall Street could get along without
him.”</p>

<p>“But if they’re only going to stay two
weeks, Bob,” began Babe hastily, “I don’t
see why&mdash;&mdash;” She stopped in sudden confusion.</p>

<p>“Why what?” demanded Katherine curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, why I’ve talked such a lot about it,
she means,” explained Bob calmly. “When
these leave there are others coming, Babe.
There’s an unlimited supply of fresh-air
children,&mdash;millions of them. That’s why we
can’t keep Jimmie Scheverin more than two
weeks, in spite of his enthusiasm for father’s
oratory and father’s enthusiasm for Jimmie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
So it’s no use trying to persuade me to go off
on frivolous trips with you.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Babe?” asked Betty
idly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that I’m going anywhere,”
said Babe, with a conscious little
giggle. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>Betty explained that they were going to
have a cottage for a month or two at some seaside
place near New York&mdash;it hadn’t been decided
when she left home, but father was
going to write her. This information the B’s
and Madeline received with solicitous and
solemn interest. Indeed they asked Betty so
many questions, that Mary finally declared
her wedding was being shamefully neglected.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the wedding,” said
Mrs. Brooks, appearing at that minute,
“but the groom is on the piazza, and six presents
have come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>In the rush down-stairs that followed Babbie
pulled Babe into a corner. “You’ll let the
cat out of the bag if you’re not more careful,”
she declared reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I will be more careful,” Babe promised.
“But why doesn’t her father hurry up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
decide? I shall burst if I can’t talk about it
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“The loveliest old brass samovar,” cried
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“From Miss Ferris!” added Betty. “That
makes it all the nicer.”</p>

<p>“And a silver dish from Prexie and Mrs.
Prexie.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you get for marrying a
faculty.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it distinguished?” said Babbie, rushing
after the others. “I don’t see how you
can think of anything else, Babe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t go abroad every summer
the way you do,” explained Babe breathlessly.
“The most distinguished wedding that ever
happened couldn’t make me forget that I’m
going to see Paris and London and all the rest
of Europe.”</p>

<p>“Not quite all, I hope,” laughed Babbie,
hurrying to shake hands with Dr. Hinsdale
and Marion Lawrence, who was going to be
Mary’s maid of honor.</p>

<p>Everybody agreed that Mary’s impromptu
wedding was a decided improvement upon the
usual cut-and-dried variety. There was certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
nothing cut and dried about it. When
the sun had gone below the tops of the tall
elm trees on the lawn and the shadows fell,
long and cool, on the velvety grass, Mary
appeared on the piazza, wearing a soft white
dress&mdash;“that didn’t look a bit like a wedding,”
as little Helen Adams announced with her
customary frankness. First she kissed her
mother and patted her father’s shoulder lovingly,
just as she did every morning before
breakfast, and then she shook hands with
everybody else, as unconcernedly as if it was
no day in particular and all her dearest friends
had merely happened to drop in for afternoon
tea. But all at once, before anybody except
the people concerned had noticed it, there was
a cleared space in one corner, with a screen of
ferns and white sweet peas for a background.
Laurie and Roberta and Betty were close
behind Mary, her father and Dr. Hinsdale
were beside her, the “near-bridesmaids” and
“near-ushers,” as K. had flippantly dubbed
the rest of the bridal party, made a half circle
around the others, and Mary Brooks, with one
great white rose in her hand and a half-frightened,
half-happy little smile on her lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
was being married to George Garrison Hinsdale.</p>

<p>When it was over, everybody went indoors
and had all sorts of cooling things to eat
and drink. Meanwhile the bridesmaids, and
“near-brides” had slipped away to put on
some Roumanian peasant costumes, and “the
next number on the program”&mdash;according to
Katherine&mdash;was some curious wedding dances
that Roberta had learned and taught to the
others. Some were graceful and some were
amusing, and the music was so gay that it
made everybody feel like dancing too. And
that was what they did, by the soft light of
Japanese lanterns, until it was time to fill
one’s hands with confetti and old slippers and
speed the wedding-pair on their way to the
desert island that would not be deserted any
more that summer.</p>

<p>As the girls sat on the piazza talking it all
over with Mrs. Brooks, who declared she
simply couldn’t realize that “little Mary”
was old enough to be getting married, Dr.
Brooks came out, bringing a letter for Betty.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me how long I’ve had it in my
pocket, Miss Betty,” he said with a twinkle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in his eyes. “It beats everything how a wedding
does upset me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter,” laughed Betty,
“as long as you’ve remembered it in time for
me to know where I’m going to-morrow.
It’s from father, telling me which cottage
they’ve taken. Will you excuse me if I read
it right now, Mrs. Brooks?”</p>

<p>The next minute Betty gave a little shriek
of delight, dropped her letter, and seizing
Babbie’s hands whirled her madly down the
length of the piazza. Finally she dropped
breathlessly down on the broad railing, pulling
Babbie to a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just too elegant for anything!”
she sighed. “And to think how near Babe
came to telling, and I never guessed a thing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">A GOING-AWAY PARTY&mdash;HARDING STYLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a while everybody who didn’t know
what the excitement was about asked questions
at once, and everybody who did, which
meant the B’s and Madeline, answered at
once,&mdash;a process resulting in that delightful
confusion that is the very nicest part about
telling a secret. Finally things quieted down
a little, and Babbie was called upon to “tell
us all about it.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s just this way,” she explained.
“Mother’s doctor ordered her to Europe. She
isn’t strong, you know, and the change is good
for her. But he said she mustn’t motor this
time because it’s too wearing; but must travel
quietly, and rest a lot, and so on. Well,
mother isn’t much for quiet herself, so she was
afraid I might be bored, just with her and
Marie, and no car to run while she takes naps.
So she told me to ask Bob and Babe to join us&mdash;this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
all came up after commencement, you
understand. And Babe would, but Bob
wouldn’t, because of her fresh-air kids; so then
I asked Betty. Not that she’s second choice
one bit,” added Babbie hastily, “only of
course the B’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You needn’t apologize,” Betty interrupted
her. “Of course the B’s ask each other first!
As for me, I’m too overjoyed to be going to
think of anything else.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why you didn’t tell her
that you’d asked her,” said little Helen Adams,
the practical minded.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was mother’s idea,” Babbie went
on. “She wanted you to come, Betty, just as
much as I did; but she said that she didn’t
know your father and mother, and she didn’t
know how they would feel about trusting their
daughter for a whole summer to a perfect
stranger. And she thought it would be easier
for them to refuse, for that or any other
reason, if you didn’t know. Oh, I’ve just
been aching to have you get that letter,” sighed
Babbie rapturously.</p>

<p>“But suppose it had said the wrong thing,”
suggested Babe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“Then we could have talked about it all the
same,” put in Madeline. “I like the way you
leave me out of all your explanations, Babbie
Hildreth.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t think of everything at once,”
Babbie defended herself. “Besides, you just
dropped in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m only the impromptu feature,”
said Madeline sadly. “I always am. As I
have often explained before, I was born that
way.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you were in a terrible rush
to get to Sorrento,” said Rachel.</p>

<p>“I was,” admitted Madeline. “But after
all why should I be in a rush? Why
shouldn’t I go to Sorrento via some fun just
as well as by any other route? Sorrento will
keep.”</p>

<p>“Where is your party going, Babbie?” inquired
Mrs. Brooks, who had been much entertained
by all the excitement.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to sail to Glasgow,
because we couldn’t get passage to any other
port on such short notice. And then the
doctor thinks mother ought to have some cool,
bracing air to begin with. After that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
don’t know. Mother says that we girls may
choose, and of course Babe and I didn’t want
to discuss it without Betty. And now Madeline
says that it’s more fun just deciding as
you go along. Mother thought it would be
dull without a car,” Babbie went on eagerly,
“but do you know I think it’s going to be more
exciting without one, because when you have
it you feel as if you ought to use it, and you
have to keep to good roads. I always thought
that when James didn’t want to go to a place,
or Marie didn’t, James said the road was bad.
Marie hates little villages, and I just love them.
And Madeline will think up all sorts of queer,
fascinating things to do.”</p>

<p>“The principal feature, though impromptu,”
murmured Madeline. “Are you
going away back home again for the week
before we sail, Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. “Nan has packed
the things she thinks I’ll want, and I’m to
join her at Shelter Island and help get the
cottage ready for the rest of the family.
They’ll all be here in time to see me off.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask us all down there to
spend the day?” suggested Madeline. “Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
perhaps our stay-at-home friends would take
the hint and give a going-away party for us.”</p>

<p>“But we shan’t be here,” chorused Helen,
Roberta, Rachel, Eleanor, and Katherine.</p>

<p>“And I couldn’t possibly come down for all
day. Daddy won’t desert Wall Street so soon
again,” added Bob sadly.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame not to have the party. We
could think of lots of lovely things to do,”
sighed Roberta.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with doing them to-morrow?”
proposed Dr. Brooks. “You can’t
leave Mrs. Brooks and me too suddenly, you
know. We’ve got to get used to missing Mary
gradually. Now I’ll take you all to town in
the morning and give you lunch at my club.
By the time we get back, the house will be in
order again and we’ll have that going-away
party to amuse us during the evening.”</p>

<p>There was a little objection at first, for all
the girls had expected to leave the next day;
but Dr. Brooks speedily overruled their arguments.
They had come to the wedding, he
declared, and cheering up the bereft parents
was part of the ceremony&mdash;everybody knew
that; whereas one day at the other end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
trip wouldn’t matter at all. So Babe nominated Bob
and Roberta as committee on arrangements
for the going-away party and, according
to “Merry Heart” procedure, unceremoniously
declared them elected, after which
Dr. Brooks carried them off to his study to
make plans for the next day’s campaign.</p>

<p>The going-away party was a distinctly collegiate
function, marked by all the originality
and joyous abandon that belong by right to
every Harding festivity. Contrary to social
precedent it began with toasts. That was
Eleanor’s fault, Bob explained. She had
made a mistake and put ice in the lemonade
too soon, and so it had to be drunk immediately.
So Katherine grew eloquent on “the
Sorrows of Parting for the Second Time in
Two Weeks, when you have exhausted all
your pretty speeches on the first round.” Bob
described “Europe As I Shall Not See It,” and
Babe “Europe As I Hope to See It if not
Prevented by the Frivolity of my Friends.”
Madeline was really witty in her account
of “the Impromptu Elements in Foreign
Travel&mdash;myself, the English climate, and
others.” Rachel toasted “the Desert Island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Honeymooners, absent but not forgotten,” and
Dr. Brooks explained “the Uses of Near-Bridesmaids,”
to the infinite amusement of
his guests. After that Roberta said she was
sorry about there not being time for the other
toasts, but they were all written down on the
program and if everybody would tell Babbie
that hers was too cute for anything and
Eleanor that she could certainly make the
best speeches, they would pass on to the
“stunts.”</p>

<p>These consisted of examinations to test the
fitness of the European party for its trip.
Betty was the first victim. She was required
to tie on a chiffon veil “so you will look too
sweet for anything and all the men on board
the boat will be crazy about you,”&mdash;though
Rachel pointed out that it wasn’t much of a
test, because Betty always looked that way.
Next Madeline was requested to prove that
she knew how to be seasick on the proper occasions.
Babe, whose French accent had been
a college joke, was made to “parler-vous” an
order for lunch, though she protested hotly
that Babbie and Madeline were going to do
that part&mdash;she had made her family promise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
solemnly that she shouldn’t be bothered with
learning anything ever any more, till she
wanted to. And Babbie, who had announced
in one breath that she was going to travel
with just one little steamer trunk this time,
and in the next that she should buy four
dresses at least in Paris, was invited to demonstrate
how she meant to carry the clothes she
needed for the trip and the four dresses all in
“one little trunk.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention the things you are going
to bring home to us,” Bob reminded her.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I shall have Marie pack the
dresses in one of mother’s trunks,” Babbie
explained easily.</p>

<p>“Crawl!” declared K. “As a forfeit you
are condemned to do ‘Mary had a little lamb’
in your best style.”</p>

<p>“And Roberta ought to do the jabber-wock
for us,” suggested Eleanor.</p>

<p>“And Madeline ought to sing a French
song,” added Betty.</p>

<p>So all the “Merry Heart” stunts, that had
amused them at Harding for four long years,
and were just as funny now as they had ever
been, were merrily gone through with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” declaimed Bob at
last, “we have at last arrived at the real business
of this farewell party, which is the presentation
of a few slight tokens of our affection,
and the delicate intimation of the objects
of art&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or wearing apparel,” put in K.</p>

<p>“That we should most like to get in return,”
concluded Bob pompously, with a withering
glance in K.’s direction. “I may say in
passing that the aforesaid intimation is strictly
by request.”</p>

<p>The stay-at-homes and Dr. Brooks disappeared
for a few minutes and came back in a
laughing, bundle-laden procession, with Dr.
Brooks at its head.</p>

<p>“I heartily approve of your resolution to
travel with as little baggage as possible,” said
the doctor solemnly, “so I’ve put up these
prescriptions for seasickness in as concentrated
a form as possible.” And he presented
Betty and Babbie each with a half-gallon
bottle, and Babe and Madeline with huge
wooden boxes marked “Pills.” A tag on
Babe’s read, “To be exchanged for fruit on
day of sailing.” Madeline’s tag said, “Good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
for the same size at Huyler’s,” while Betty’s
specified salted almonds, and Babbie’s preserved
ginger.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that the goods are delivered at
your boat,” the doctor assured them, “and if
the ship’s physician doesn’t get some practice
out of you it certainly won’t be my fault.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told us what you want
us to bring you,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Yourselves safe and sound,” said Dr.
Brooks gallantly.</p>

<p>The girls were not so modest. Helen, who
had stayed at home from the city to print the
travelers’ names in indelible ink on three
dozen laundry markers apiece, confessed shyly
that she had always wanted a good photograph
of the Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>“To think that you’re going to see the real
one!” she said. “I’m going to begin right
away to save my money for a trip abroad.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” echoed Rachel.</p>

<p>“And I,” from K.</p>

<p>European travel was evidently the “Merry
Hearts’” latest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” laughed Eleanor,
“here are some baggage tags for the ones who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
are really going. They say you have to mark
all your bags and trunks over there, because
they don’t have checks, and you just have
to pick your things out of the big pile on the
station platforms.”</p>

<p>“What elegance,” cried Betty, holding her
shining silver marker out at arm’s length for
inspection. “And what shall we bring you,
Eleanor, dear?”</p>

<p>“A duke, if you don’t mind,” said Eleanor
solemnly, and Betty solemnly wrote it down
on the slip of paper on which she was recording
all the girls’ wishes.</p>

<p>Roberta gave them each a tiny book of travel
sketches not too big to slip into a shopping-bag&mdash;one
was about English cathedrals, another
about English inns, and the third and fourth
described some Scotch and English castles.</p>

<p>“They look rather interesting,” said Roberta
modestly, “and I remembered that none of
you was specially fond of history.”</p>

<p>“Don’t throw it in my face that I once got
a low-grade,” Babe reproached her. “Say over
again the thing that you wanted, Roberta.”</p>

<p>“A gargoyle,” repeated Roberta.</p>

<p>Betty looked at her despairingly. “Please<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
spell it, Roberta. I suppose Babbie and
Madeline know just what it is.”</p>

<p>Babbie looked mystified. “Why should I
know anything like that, Betty?”</p>

<p>“Because you’ve been to Paris six separate
times,” declared Madeline, “and motored all
through France besides. You evidently don’t
go in hard for architecture, Babbie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s architecture, is it?” said Babbie in
relieved tones. “Then I don’t see how we can
bring it home.”</p>

<p>“Only a picture of one,” Roberta expostulated.</p>

<p>“It’s not exactly architecture, Babbie,”
teased Madeline. “It’s an animal, generally.
Wouldn’t you like a real one better than a
picture, Roberta? They have them in the
Rue Bonaparte for two francs each.”</p>

<p>By this time everybody was excited on the
subject of gargoyles and ready to listen while
Roberta explained that gargoyles are the
grotesque figures, usually in the shape of
animals, that ornament Gothic cathedrals,
especially the French ones.</p>

<p>“They’re waterspouts as well as ornaments,”
protested Madeline. “Babbie Hildreth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
you don’t half know your Paris. Prepare
to walk down to Notre Dame in the rain
with me and see the gargoyles work.”</p>

<p>“They sound perfectly fascinating,” said
Rachel. “Here’s a picture of one in this book
on architecture that I’ve brought for you. I believe
I’d rather have one than a pair of gloves.
Is two francs a lot of money, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t, I want a gargoyle too,” declared
K. “Is there more than one kind?”</p>

<p>“Enough kinds to suit all tastes,” laughed
Madeline. “It will be great fun picking out
appropriate gargoyles for the three of you.
What have you in that bundle, K.?”</p>

<p>K. tossed the fat parcel at the travelers,
who found inside a pillow covered with
brown linen, with a 19&mdash; banner fastened
across it by way of ornament. “I hope you
won’t all feel like sleeping in your steamer
chairs at the same time,” she said. “I
couldn’t afford but one pillow, and I hadn’t
time to make any more banners.”</p>

<p>Bob’s gift was four little towels, just the
right size to slip into a traveling bag for use
on trains or in railway stations, a fat little
pincushion with a bow to hang it up by on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
shipboard, and a little silk bag fitted with
needles, bodkins, thread, darning cotton,
buttons, hooks, a tiny pair of scissors, and
everything else that one could need in a
mending outfit.</p>

<p>“A cousin of mine gave it to me for a graduating
present,” explained Bob, when the bag
had been duly admired, “but it makes me
sort of tired to look at it and think how many
things it would mend, and as the cousin is
safe in California, and I knew Betty would
take to it, I’m passing it on.”</p>

<p>“We shall all take to it, I guess, as often
as our clothes come to pieces,” declared Babe.
“What shall we bring you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know&mdash;something queer and
out-of-the-way, that I can put on my dear old
Harding desk or hang up on the wall above
it. I don’t mean a picture, but any queer old
thing that you would know came from abroad
the minute you set eyes on it from afar.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that be fun to hunt up,” murmured
Betty ecstatically, adding Bob’s choice to the
others. “Now, Mrs. Brooks, what shall we
bring you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what she’d rather have,” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Babbie, leaning over to whisper something in
Betty’s ear and Betty laughed and wrote a
few words on her paper. “It’s something
that we know you admire,” explained Babbie,
“because Mary had one nearly the same and
you said you wished you were a bride, so
people would give you such things. But perhaps
you’d rather choose for yourself.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Brooks professed herself quite
willing to abide by Babbie’s choice. She had
already told the girls that her going-away
present to them was to be flowers, so “the real
business of the meeting,” as Bob had expressed
it, was now over; and as everybody was leaving
early the next morning, it seemed best to
adjourn.</p>

<p>There was nothing dismal about the good-byes
next day. Bob was the only one who
would be at the steamer to wave the travelers
a farewell, but the rest promised to write
steamer letters, and as Roberta said, “something
will turn up before long to bring us together
again. Things happen so fast in the
wide, wide world.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if a September reunion
would amount to much,” said K., “with three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
school-ma’ams and a foreign resident in the
crowd.”</p>

<p>“Somebody must get married,” announced
Babe. “People can always manage to come
to weddings. You’re all going to be married
sooner or later, except me and Bob&mdash;we’re
the man-haters’ union, you know&mdash;and
you might just as well be accommodating and
hurry up about it.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to bring me a duke from
abroad,” Eleanor reminded her laughingly.
“If you pick out a nice one, I may decide to
use him for a husband.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll pick out a nice one.
Won’t it be fun assisting at the nuptials of a
duke, girls? Grander even than the wedding
of a Harding professor.”</p>

<p>“I hereby prophesy that Babe’s wedding is
next on the list,” cried K. gaily.</p>

<p>“Why, Katherine Kittredge,” retorted
Babe indignantly, “haven’t I always
said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s the point,” K. interrupted her.
“Professed man-haters always marry young.
There was Jane Westover and&mdash;there’s my
train. Besides, you owe it to the crowd to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
accommodating and abandon man-hating in
the interests of matrimony and reunions.”</p>

<p>“My wedding next on the list, indeed!”
murmured Babe angrily, as she waved her
handkerchief at the departing train. “We’re
going to be bachelor maids, aren’t we, Bob?
with saddle-horses and Scotch collies instead
of cats and canaries&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And fresh-air children in the summers,”
added Bob absently. “I wonder what daddy’s
doing to keep Jimmie Scheverin out of mischief.
Here’s our train to town, girls.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I can’t</span> believe yet that I’m really going!”
Betty Wales stood on the promenade
deck of the Glasgow boat, her arms full of
Mrs. Brooks’s roses and Dr. Brooks’s salted
almonds. Will’s arms were full of flowers
too, and the Smallest Sister felt very important
indeed because she had been entrusted with a
fat package of steamer letters from Betty’s
Cleveland friends.</p>

<p>“Beginning to feel a little homesick already?”
teased Will.</p>

<p>Betty winked hard, and mother told Will
that he wasn’t playing fair, and suggested that
they should find the girls’ stateroom and leave
some of their bundles in it.</p>

<p>“Miss Ayres is having a hunt for her trunk,”
said Nan, joining them. “It isn’t in your
stateroom, and it doesn’t seem to be on the
wharf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Why, she said she marked it to be put in
the hold,” said Betty. “Has she asked if it’s
there?” And Will was hurried off to find
Madeline and inquire.</p>

<p>It wasn’t easy finding anybody or anything
on that dock. The edges were crowded with
people, the centre was filled with a confused
mass of struggling truck horses and shouting
drivers who were all terribly anxious to get
somewhere, and didn’t seem to make the least
progress in spite of all their noise. Deck-hands
were busy with trunks and boxes, which
they fastened to a pulley and swung out over
the heads of the people, and then up and down
again, into the hold. Once in a while a
hansom wriggled its way through the drays to
let out an excited passenger, who always acted
as if he had expected to find the boat gone
without him.</p>

<p>That was the way Bob acted, as she jumped
out of her hansom and ran up the gangplank,
holding a small boy tight by each hand and
not paying the least attention to Babe and
Betty, who shrieked frantically at her from
their lookout on the upper deck.</p>

<p>“I had to bring these,” she explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
breathlessly, when the Smallest Sister had intercepted
her and conducted her to her friends.
“The housekeeper took two off my hands for
the day and the coachman took two, but
nobody would take Jimmie or Joe.”</p>

<p>“A guy on de dock’s tryin’ to spiel wid
ye,” announced Jimmie, who had lost no
time in climbing up on the ship’s railing; and
there, sure enough, was Mr. Richard Blake,
with a fresh supply of flowers, making a
megaphone of his hands and trying to ask
where he should find Madeline.</p>

<p>“Somewhere down there,” shrieked back
Betty. “But you’d better come up here and
wait. Babbie and Mrs. Hildreth haven’t even
come yet,” she added to the others. “What
if they should be too late?”</p>

<p>“Seasoned travelers never come on board
till the last minute,” said Nan. “It shows
that you’re new to the business to be standing
around like this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it’s such fun to watch everything,”
objected Babe. “I don’t mind people’s
knowing that it’s my first trip. It is, you
see. What’s that bell ringing for?”</p>

<p>Mr. Wales looked at his watch. “It means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
that in five minutes more they’re going to put
us fellows off.”</p>

<p>At that Babe got into a corner with her
mother and father, and Betty into another
with her family, leaving Bob to entertain Mr.
Blake until Madeline sauntered up with the
cheerful news that her trunk seemed to be lost
“for keeps.”</p>

<p>“Just send it along if you happen to run
into it anywhere, Dickie,” she said, and Mr.
Blake promised to find it if it was anywhere
in “little old New York.”</p>

<p>When the second bell had rung and the boat
began to empty of its visitors the girls remembered
Babbie again and began to be really
alarmed. But just as Betty was frantically
trying to ask her father, who had established
his party on the edge of the dock, what in the
world they should do if the Hildreths didn’t
come, Babbie appeared, cool and serene in
the prettiest of silk traveling suits. “Oh, I
thought you knew we’d come on board,” she
apologized. “Mother’s lying down and Marie
is with her, and I&mdash;&mdash;” Babbie blushed
prettily. “Jack is awfully shy, and he just
hates to meet a lot of people, so we stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
down below. I’m so sorry.” Babbie caught
sight of a tall youth shouldering his way to
the edge of the wharf, and waved a big bunch
of violets at him.</p>

<p>“I wish we could start now,” said Madeline.
“This shouting last speeches indefinitely isn’t
all that it might be. Dick looks bored to
death.”</p>

<p>“They’re taking up the gangplank,” announced
Babe excitedly, tossing a rose to Will.</p>

<p>Just then a hansom drew up with a jerk, a
distinguished-looking gentleman tumbled out;
Jimmie Scheverin wriggled away from Bob’s
firm grasp and jumped to the horse’s head, and
the driver called to the crowd in general to
“lend him a hand” with the trunk.</p>

<p>“No use hurrying now. They’ve given you
up,” called somebody, and the crowd roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, give de guy anudder chanst,”
cried Jimmie shrilly, and even the dignified
gentleman laughed at that. He could afford
to, for they were letting down the gangplank
again.</p>

<p>“He’s a prominent senator,” Babe whispered
eagerly. “I heard a man say so. Think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
having a boat wait for you! Well, we’re off
at last. Dear mummy! Goodness, father
waved so hard that he almost fell into the
water! Betty Wales, are you crying too?”</p>

<p>The wharf was backing away from them;
the crowd of excited people, shouting and
waving flags and handkerchiefs, was only a
great blur of color now.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over,” said Madeline gaily.
“I hate good-byes. Babe, cheer up. It’s only
for three months, and you’re going to have the
time of your life. Come and get bath hours
and places for our steamer chairs, and then we
can explore the boat a little before it’s time to
eat our first and possibly our last meal afloat.”</p>

<p>“And we must look at the mail,” added
Babbie, “and give most of our flowers to the
stewardess to put on our table in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad we’ve got some experienced
travelers in the party?” laughed Babe,
wiping away the tears, and taking Betty’s arm
she marched her off after the others. “Now
how did they know that was the deck steward?
I should be afraid of mixing him up
with the captain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Three days later Babe smiled loftily at the
recollection of such pitiful ignorance. She
had explored the ship from stem to stern, had
stood on the bridge with the captain, danced
with the ship’s doctor, exchanged views on
the weather with the senator who had kept
the boat waiting, played deck golf and shuffle-board,
and made friends with all the children
on the ship. All this she had done the first
day out. The other two she had spent forlornly
in her berth, with the stewardess to
wait on her, Babbie and Madeline to amuse
her, when she felt equal to being amused, and
Betty to keep her company.</p>

<p>“Betty’s getting ready to come up here
too,” she announced on the third afternoon,
tucking herself into the chair beside Babbie.
“Now we can decide where we’re going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s time enough for that,” objected
Madeline lazily. “Let’s enjoy the luxurious
idleness of shipboard while we can.”</p>

<p>Babbie yawned. “I don’t enjoy it. A day
or so is all right, but eight!”</p>

<p>“Specially if you’re inclined to be seasick,”
put in Babe with feeling.</p>

<p>Betty appeared just then, and she agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
with the B’s. “It’s all right if you’re an invalid
or tired, but as for me, I don’t see why
people talk so much about the joys of the trip
across. Being cooped up so long is stupid, and
makes everybody else act stupid, and it’s just
dreadfully dull.”</p>

<p>“And there aren’t any possibilities in it,
somehow,” added Babe. “Of course you may
meet some interesting people, but you can’t do
anything but just talk to them a little and
pass on.”</p>

<p>“Like ‘ships that pass in the night,’” quoted
Babbie solemnly. “I always associate the
people I’ve met on shipboard with too much
to eat and no place to put your clothes.”</p>

<p>“And seasickish headaches,” added Babe.
“Isn’t it almost time for bouillon? The doctor
told me to keep eating and I’d be all right.”</p>

<p>“There’s the bugle for it this minute,” said
Madeline, “and after that I propose a stunt.
Let’s all go off separately and see what excitement
we can unearth,&mdash;who can unearth the
most, I mean. I don’t agree with you about
the possibilities of shipboard. A town of
seven hundred people certainly has possibilities,
and that’s what we are,&mdash;a floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
town. In order to make the contest more exciting,
let’s give the winner a chance to say
where we shall go first from Glasgow.”</p>

<p>“Goodie!” cried Babbie. “That’s something
like. I knew you’d think up things to
do, Madeline. Do you two invalids feel equal
to so much exertion?”</p>

<p>The invalids declared that after they had
had their mid-afternoon repast they should
feel equal to anything, and five minutes later
the four chairs were deserted.</p>

<p>“Time limit, two hours,” called Madeline,
as she disappeared around the corner. “Meet
in our chairs, of course.”</p>

<p>Betty lingered a little. Madeline’s plan
sounded very amusing, but she hadn’t much
idea how to carry out her part of it. She
sauntered slowly down the deck, past the row
of steamer chairs, many of whose occupants
smiled and nodded at her as she passed. They
might be very exciting people, Betty reflected,
but she should never find it out. Madeline
could do that sort of thing, not she. At the
end of the deck Betty stopped and leaning
over the railing looked off out to sea, wondering
what Will and Nan and the Smallest Sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
were doing just then. Presently her glance
fell to the deck below. It was full of the
queerest people. They were having a mid-afternoon
lunch too,&mdash;drinking it with gusto
out of big tin cups. Most of them were men,
but near the cabin-door sprawled several children,
and a few women, with bright-colored
shawls over their heads, sunned themselves by
the railing.</p>

<p>“Oh, that must be the steerage!” thought
Betty, and didn’t know she had said it out
loud until somebody answered her.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the steerage,” said a deep voice
close to her elbow. “Should you like to go
down and see what the steerage is like?”</p>

<p>Betty looked around and recognized the
senator who had kept the boat waiting.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;yes,” she began, blushing at the
idea of talking to such a great man. “I should
like to see it, only&mdash;isn’t it dreadfully dirty?”</p>

<p>The senator laughed. “I hope not. If it
is, we needn’t stay long. You see&mdash;it’s a profound
secret from the ship’s officials&mdash;but I’m
going over on purpose to investigate steerages.
I’m seriously thinking of coming back in one
from Liverpool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“You are!” Betty’s eyes opened wide in
amazement. “Without letting any one know
who you are?”</p>

<p>The senator nodded. “Exactly. And by
the same token I’m making this little visit
to-day quite impromptu. Want to come?
You can talk to the women and find out if
they’re being made comfortable.”</p>

<p>“If this isn’t exciting, I don’t know what
is,” Betty reflected, following the senator down
the steps to the lower deck and past the
guard,&mdash;who looked very threatening at first,
but bowed profoundly when he saw the senator’s
card,&mdash;into the network of low-ceiled
passages beyond the tiny square of open deck.
It was dirty, or at least it was unpleasantly
smelly. But by the time Betty had satisfied
her curiosity and would much rather have
turned and gone straight back to her comfortable
steamer chair, the senator had forgotten
all about her, and surrounded by a group
of eager men was deep in his investigation.</p>

<p>“I can’t interrupt, and I can’t very well
skip off without saying anything,” thought
Betty sadly, “because he might remember me
after a while and try to find me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Judging by their conversation with the
senator, most of the steerage passengers seemed
to be men&mdash;Scotch or Irish, going back to the
“Ould Country” for a visit to the “ould
folks.” Betty listened a few minutes, and
then went on to the end of the passage, which
opened out into a room that seemed to be
salon and dining-hall combined. Though
this room was nearly empty, the air was close
and stifling and Betty was going back to the
deck to wait there for the senator, when her
attention was attracted by a group of women
gathered in one corner. They were standing
around a little figure that sat huddled in a
forlorn heap on the wooden bench along the
wall. The woman&mdash;or the child, for she
looked hardly more than that&mdash;hugged a baby
tight in her arms, and rocked it back and forward,
moaning pitifully to herself all the
time.</p>

<p>Betty hesitated for an instant, and then
went timidly up to the group. “What’s the
matter?” she asked softly of one of the bystanders,
a fat Irishwoman. “Can’t we do
something to stop her crying like that?”</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s sore thruble she’s in, the pore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
young crayther,” explained the woman
eagerly. “Her fayther and her mither and
her two brothers died in the same week av
the dipthery, and she’s takin’ her baby sister
home to the ould folks. An’ she’s lost the
money for her ticket to County Cork.”</p>

<p>“You mean she hasn’t any money at all?”
asked Betty in amazement.</p>

<p>“Niver a cint,” the sympathetic Irishwoman
assured her. “Shure, ’twas lost or
stolen the first day out. Anyhow ’tis gone.”</p>

<p>“An’ we’ve none of us ony over to be
lendin’ her,” another woman put in. “The
times is that bad, an’ all.”</p>

<p>“How much does it cost to go to County
Cork?”</p>

<p>“A pound an’ six from Derry.”</p>

<p>“How much is that, and how do you get to
‘Derry’?” asked Betty in bewilderment.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Oh, the boat lets you off at Derry, if you’re
for the ould country,” explained her interlocutress,
“and a pound an’ six is $6.50 in the
States money, miss. But she’d need a bite an’
a sup on the way for her an’ the babe.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p class="p2b">The girl had apparently paid no attention at
all to this colloquy. But now she lifted her tear-stained
face to Betty’s and held out the baby.
“It’s only for her I’m carin’,” she said. “I
had ten dollars saved over my passage back
an’ the train ticket, an’ that goes a long way
in Ireland. The old folks are poor, too, but I
thought they’d take her in for that, and what
I could be sendin’ them later. I couldn’t
tend her an’ work, too, but whatever shall I
do over here? There’s no work at all in Ireland.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“IT’S ONLY FOR HER I’M CARIN’”</p>

<p class="p2">“What a darling baby!” cried Betty, as the
blue eyes opened and the little red face crumpled
itself into a tremendous yawn. “Why,
I never saw such big blue eyes!” The little
mother smiled faintly at this praise, and Betty
wanted to add that big blue eyes evidently
ran in the family. Instead she said, “Please
don’t feel so unhappy. I’ll see that you have
the money for the ticket to your friends, and
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;” Betty stopped, not wishing to
promise anything for the others, though she
was sure that if Babbie saw the baby’s eyes
she would reduce the number of dresses she
meant to buy in Paris to three without a
murmur.</p>

<p>“An’ she ain’t the worst off, ayther, ma’am,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
put in Betty’s voluble informant. “There’s
an English gyrul that’s sick, pore dear, in her
bunk, wid an awful rackin’ cough and a face
as pale as death, an’ it’s tin cints she do be
havin’ to take her home to her mither that’s
a coster-woman in London town, an’ wants to
see her daughter before she dies.”</p>

<p>“But why did she start if she didn’t have
enough money?” demanded Betty.</p>

<p>“Wudn’t you, dearie, if you was dyin’ and
knew it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, here you are. Are you ready to go
back?” The senator had pumped his audience
dry, and remembered Betty. “Well, how
is it? Do they complain of the service?” he
asked, as they went back to the upper deck.</p>

<p>“The service&mdash;oh, I’m so sorry! I hadn’t
gotten around to ask them,” said Betty meekly,
and then burst out with the stories she had
heard.</p>

<p>The senator listened intently, and his keen
eyes grew soft, as he fumbled for his pocketbook.
“That’s the point, my dear young
lady,” he said soberly. “After all, what are
two weeks’ comfort or discomfort to people as
poor as most of those? I saw a miserable fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
too,&mdash;sick and discouraged, taking his
motherless children back home before he dies.
But your girl is worse off. Give her this. It
will help a little.”</p>

<p>Betty gasped at the size of the bill, but the
senator murmured something about wanting
to smoke and hurried off, and there was nothing
to do but go back to the others. She was
the last of the quartette to reach the rendezvous.</p>

<p>“Two minutes late,” called Madeline as she
appeared.</p>

<p>“That’s lucky,” laughed Betty, tucking her
rug in, “because I couldn’t possibly decide
where to go from Glasgow&mdash;I don’t know
enough about the geography of Scotland&mdash;and
my story is perfectly sure to take the
prize.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Babe doubtfully. “I saw
you. You needn’t be puffed up because you
leaned over the railing and talked to a live
senator. I’ve been talking to a live actress&mdash;there’s
a whole company of them on board,
Madeline, and you’ve never discovered them.”</p>

<p>“Which is she?” asked Babbie. “The
stunning woman with the blue velvet suit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“No, the little mouse-like one with gray
furs, and she’s played with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait,” commanded Madeline. “You’ve
told enough for the first time round. The
stunning woman in blue velvet, if you
care to know, is the maid of the mouse-like
actress. I’ve talked to her. Now, Babbie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m out of it,” explained Babbie.
“Marie has a sore throat, and mother wanted
to be read aloud to.”</p>

<p>“Well, the senator is only one of the people
I’ve talked to,” put in Betty eagerly.
“I’ve been in the steerage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, you lucky girl,” cried Madeline. “I
tried to go yesterday and got turned down.
How did you get past the guard? Do tell
us all about it.”</p>

<p>So Betty “told,” saving the senator’s bill
for a climax. At the end of the story Babbie
declared that she simply must see the blue-eyed
Irish baby, and Babe winked back the
tears over the lonely English girl. While they
were talking, some Harding girls of an older
generation came up and made Madeline’s
Dramatic Club pin an excuse for introducing
themselves. Of course they heard about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Betty’s visit to the steerage, and they were so
interested that Madeline had an idea.</p>

<p>“All the passengers would like to help those
poor people, I’m sure. Couldn’t we give an
entertainment of some sort? There’s the captain,
Babe. Go ask him if he’s willing.”</p>

<p>The captain assured Babe that “any show
she wanted went on his boat,” the little gray-gowned
actress, who had refused to appear at
the ship’s concert, promised that she and her
leading man would act a farce, the senator
volunteered to canvass the steerage for somebody
to dance an Irish jig, Babbie designed
some dainty souvenir programs, and the other
crowd of Harding girls arranged a “stunt
number” that proved to be the star feature of
the evening. Betty printed the tickets, and
the senator sold them all at twenty-five
cents “or over,” with astonishing financial
results.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said as he passed the
money over to Betty. “There are three
hundred first class passengers on this boat, but
six of them are judges&mdash;they pay double&mdash;and
five are colonels&mdash;it takes three tickets to get
in a colonel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“And how many to get in a senator?”
laughed Betty.</p>

<p>“Twenty,” said the senator solemnly, taking
them out of his pocket.</p>

<p>So there was enough money to get the English
girl to London, and the Irish girl to
County Cork and then back to the States to
work for her blue-eyed baby sister, and something
over to pay the baby’s board with the
“ould folks,” and to help out the poor man
with the big family of children.</p>

<p>“And the best of it is, it’s given us something
to do,” said Babe the last afternoon on
board. “I don’t believe I should have been
seasick if we’d thought of this sooner.”</p>

<p>“Easy to say that when land is in sight,”
said Madeline loftily, squinting at the horizon
line.</p>

<p>And sure enough land was in sight and
presently it turned out to be the loveliest,
greenest land that the girls had ever seen.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Babe excitedly.
“An island or a country?”</p>

<p>None of the girls knew, but a friendly passenger
explained that it was both an island
and a country, for it was Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Why, of course,” cried Babe. “That’s why
it’s so green. Is it really greener than other
places, or does it only look greener because
we haven’t seen any other places for eight
days?”</p>

<p>Madeline and Betty thought it was really
greener, while the B’s inclined to the opinion
that it couldn’t be&mdash;that it was the atmosphere,
perhaps.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly a queer atmosphere,” said
Babe, as they hurried up on deck after dinner,
to see the tender full of passengers off for
“Derry.” “It’s eight o’clock this minute,
and the sunset hasn’t finished up.”</p>

<p>“See that lovely white farmhouse up on
that hill,” said Betty, pointing toward land.
“Doesn’t it look as if there were fairies in
those fields, girls?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the fairies,” said
Babe, “but I love the way the white foam
breaks on the green moss. Let’s go to Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t decided”&mdash;chanted four
voices together.</p>

<p>“Where we’ll go from Glasgow,” finished
Babbie alone. “Well, it doesn’t matter, because
mother will have to rest a day or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
before we go anywhere. Just think! The
poor thing hasn’t been up on deck yet.”</p>

<p>“And while she’s resting,” put in Madeline,
“we can explore Glasgow and then, if
she’s willing, go down to Ayr. That’s a nice
little day trip.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Babe reflectively.
“Ayr&mdash;Ayr&mdash;I ought to know about it, but I
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Robert Burns’ country,” explained Madeline
briefly. “Why, that tender is really
starting. Wave your handkerchiefs to the
baby’s sister, Betty. She’s almost dropping
the poor infant in her efforts to make you see
her.”</p>

<p>“I looked at the map before dinner,” announced
Babe proudly. “I know just where
we are, and the real name of ‘Derry’ is Londonderry.”</p>

<p>“I found that out too,” declared Betty.
“Maps are quite interesting when you’re on
one, aren’t they? I used to hate geography
in school, but from now on I shall adore it,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I must go and help Marie pack,” said
Babbie with a last glance at the green hills,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
that were turning a beautiful misty gray in
the twilight.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to pack too.”</p>

<p>“And go to bed early, because we’ve got to
get up early.”</p>

<p>“So as to land in Europe,” finished Babe.
“Doesn’t that sound too&mdash;sweet&mdash;elegant&mdash;grand
for anything. Come on and get busy,
girls.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A DISILLUSIONMENT MADE GOOD</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the rising bell rang uncomfortably
early, and everybody dressed and
breakfasted in nervous haste, pursued by the
fear of not being ready to get off the boat at
the critical moment. And then there was
nothing to do for an hour or so but “just wait
and wait and wait,” as Babe complained dolefully.
Babe was dreadfully impatient to
“land in Europe,” and found it simply tantalizing
to have to hang over the railing and
look at the shores of Scotland, with the little
gray town of Greenock hardly a stone’s throw
off. Betty, on the other hand, was willing to
wait because she thought Greenock so pretty,
with its curving bay, edged by a stone promenade,
and its gray stone houses, all very
much alike, standing in a neat row encircling
the shore.</p>

<p>“It’s a summer resort,” she announced,
having consulted her Baedeker, which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
had brought up on deck to see just where
they were on the map of Scotland. “I wish
we could stay there for awhile. It looks so
quiet and quaint.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look very exciting to me,” objected
Babe. “The idea of building summer
cottages of stone!”</p>

<p>“They aren’t cottages,” explained Babbie,
“they’re villas. Don’t you know how people
in English novels always go and take lodgings
in a villa by the sea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let’s do that,” cried Betty eagerly.
“It sounds so perfectly English.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking over some Scotch addresses
that Mary Brooks gave me,” said
Madeline, “and I think we ought to go to
Oban. She and Marion Lawrence both said
it was the most fascinating spot they’d ever
seen. It’s a seaside resort too, Betty, and the
address they gave me is villa something or
other, so it answers all your requirements.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the place mother’s doctor
spoke about,” put in Babbie. “I told him I
wanted to go to little out-of-the-way villages,
and he mentioned that one. How do you get
there, Madeline?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Why, by boat, I think Mary said. Let me
take your Baedeker, Betty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad she can make out trains
and things,” said Babbie, with a sigh of relief.
“Mother can’t and I can’t, and it’s such a
bother always to have to ask the hotel
people.”</p>

<p>Presently Madeline announced that she
knew just how to go to Oban by boat, and
how to come back by train, and then Marie
appeared with a message from Mrs. Hildreth
that it was time for the girls to come down-stairs
and get their hand-baggage together.</p>

<p>“But we’re not within ten miles of Glasgow
yet,” objected Babe, proud of her newly-acquired
knowledge of the geography of the
region.</p>

<p>“Oh, we go there from Greenock on a
boat-train,” Babbie told her. “And here
comes a tender or a ferry, or whatever they
call it, to take us ashore.”</p>

<p>So there was only time to say good-bye to
the funny old Scotch stewardess, who had
told them to “Come awa’” to their baths
every morning, to the other Harding girls, and
to the senator, who gave Betty his card and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
made her promise to let him know when she
came to Washington; and then they were
chug-chugging over to the Greenock station,
where Madeline instructed the novices in the
art of getting one’s trunks through the customs,
while Babbie established her mother
comfortably on the train. Madeline had
quite given up finding her trunk and was
congratulating herself on having put so many
things into her “carry-all,” when she heard
the senator protesting volubly that his name
wasn’t Ayres and that he hadn’t brought a
trunk anyway, whereupon she pounced joyously
on her property and refused to let it out
of her sight again until it had been put aboard
the Glasgow train.</p>

<p>Betty and Babe found the train very amusing.
Instead of long cars with rows of seats
on either side of the aisle, there were funny
little compartments, each holding eight or ten
people, half of whom were obliged to ride
backward whether they liked it or not. But
as this train wasn’t crowded, Mrs. Hildreth’s
party had a compartment all to themselves,
and Betty and Babe were free to exclaim as
much as they liked over the delightful queerness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of European travel. Foxgloves and
chimney-pots were the two objects of greatest
interest en route. Babbie discovered the foxgloves
growing in a pretty little grove close
by the railroad track; the chimney-pots jostled
one another on the roof of every cottage they
passed, and as they came into Glasgow made
such an impression on Babe that she could
think of nothing else and almost fell out the
window in her efforts to count the most imposing
clusters.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” she said, leaning back wearily
as the train swept into a tunnel, “how nobody
ever tells you about the things you
notice most. Now I’ve talked to quantities
of people who’ve traveled in Europe, and not
one of them ever so much as mentioned
chimney-pots.”</p>

<p>“Well, now you can make yourself famous
for your originality by mentioning them to
everybody,” said Babbie consolingly. “Here
we are in Glasgow. Who’s going to see about
the trunks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me,” volunteered Betty. “Somebody
will have to show me how the first time,
but I want to learn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>So Madeline and Betty went off to find the
trunks and have them sent to the station
hotel, where Mrs. Hildreth had decided to stay
while they were in Glasgow.</p>

<p>“It was too comical for anything,” Betty
told Babe afterward. “They just dumped all
the trunks and bags in a heap on the platform,
and each person picked out whatever
ones he pleased, and said they were his, and
got a porter to carry them away for him.
The English people must be very honest.
Imagine doing that way in America!”</p>

<p>“We’ve been ‘booked’ for rooms at the
hotel,” said Babe, laughing over the queer
word. “And that’s luggage that you’re
carrying,&mdash;not baggage any more, please remember.
So come along and have lunch and then we
can go out and see the sights.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth was quite willing that the
girls should explore Glasgow without her,
and spend the next day in Ayr, if they
pleased.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to worry about you,” she told
them, “for I’m sure you are all too sensible
to do any foolish or foolhardy things. On
the continent you may have to be a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
more particular, but here and in England you
can do about as you like.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could come too, Mrs. Hildreth,”
said Betty, when they were ready to start.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth smiled at her. “So do I,
my dear. Just as soon as I’m a little rested,
I shall be delighted to go with you whenever
you’ll take me. I quite look forward to seeing
Europe in such good company.”</p>

<p>“Poor little mother!” said Babbie, as they
went off. “She never had a chance to do as
she liked when she was a girl. She always
had nurses and governesses trailing around
after her, and then she went to a fashionable
school in Boston, where you take walks two
and two and never stir without a chaperon.
After that she had to ‘come out’ in society,
though she hated it as much as Bob does, and
wanted to study art in Paris. But her mother
thought that was all nonsense for a girl who
had plenty of money. So when I wanted to
go to college mother let me, and she often
says she’s awfully glad that my best friends
are girls who can go ahead and have a good
time anywhere&mdash;not the helpless society
kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“I say, where are we aiming for?” Babe
demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>“For the Glasgow Cathedral,” answered
Madeline placidly. “This way, please.”</p>

<p>“This way please! Follow the man from
Cook’s,” chanted Babbie mockingly. And
after that Madeline was known as “the man
from Cook’s,” because her easy fashion of
finding her way around each place they
visited, whether or not she had been there
before, rivaled the omniscience of the great
tourist agency.</p>

<p>So under Madeline’s capable guidance they
visited the beautiful old cathedral and then
took an electric tram, which is like an electric
car with seats on the roof and a spiral stairway
at the back leading up to them, out to
the park and the art gallery. After Babe
had looked at the one great treasure of the
gallery, Whistler’s portrait of Thomas Carlyle,
she announced that she had seen enough for
one day, and would wait for the others outside.</p>

<p>“Let’s all say ‘enough,’” suggested Babbie,
“and go for a tram-ride. I move that the
man from Cook’s be censured for telling us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
that it wasn’t far enough out here to pay us
for climbing to the top-story of the tram.
Hereafter it is going to be a rule that we always
ride on top.”</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” Babe seconded her
eagerly. “My father owns a trolley line in
Rochester, New York, and I’m going to write
and tell him about this second-story idea.
I’m sure people would flock from all over the
country to ride up on the roof of the cars.
Then he’d make piles of money and I could go
abroad every summer, the way Babbie does.”</p>

<p>“Let’s just ride back to town on top,” suggested
Betty, “and then go and have tea at
the address Mary Brooks gave us. She said
it was the nicest tea-shop they went to anywhere.”</p>

<p>This suited everybody, and they had all
climbed up on the second story of the tram,
and were settling themselves for the ride
back, when Babbie gave an exclamation of
delight. “Why, that’s John Morton standing
on the steps of the art gallery. Oh, do let’s
get off! I want to go back and talk to him.
Why, I hadn’t the least idea he was in
Europe!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let’s get down again,” wailed
Betty, who had stepped on her skirt-braid
in climbing up, and was trying to repair
damages with pins. “It’s such dreadfully
hard work.”</p>

<p>“We can’t,” declared Madeline decisively.
“We’ve paid our tuppences, and we couldn’t
get them back.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could remember to say tuppence,”
sighed Babe enviously. “Who is John Morton,
Babbie? Are you sure it’s he on the
steps?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think so,” said Babbie eagerly. “I
wish he’d turn around again, and I could
be sure. He’s just the jolliest fellow, and I
haven’t seen him for two years. Oh, dear,
we’re starting!” as the tram gave a jerk and
a lurch, and was off.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Babbie,” teased Babe. “Remember
your dear Jack and the touching
farewell that caused us all so much anxiety.
We can’t be bothered with another of your
suitors so soon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t apply the title of suitor to John,
please,” laughed Babbie, leaning over for a
last look at the figure on the steps. “He’s as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
much of a professed woman-hater as you are
man-hater, but he makes an exception of me
because I like to tramp and ride horseback.
You’d like him, Babe. Madeline, do you
know where to get off for this tea place?”</p>

<p>Madeline didn’t; and as the conductor didn’t
see fit to come up, Babbie had to climb down,
while the tram was going at full speed, to
find out.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have missed this for anything,”
said Madeline, when they were settled
at one of the tables in Miss Jelliff’s Tea
Rooms. The seats were carved oak settles,
there were wonderful brass candlesticks in
niches by the door, and on the tables were
bunches of pale blue irises, to match the blue
china. The bread was in what Babe called a
“three-story revolving bread-case,” the toast
in a quaint little English toast-rack, and the
jam, pepper and mustard in fascinating pots,
while the cups, though all blue, were of different
shapes and patterns.</p>

<p>“Let me pour the tea,” begged Betty.
“Which cup do you each choose?”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad we came,” said Babe. “First
maxim for travelers: When you have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
enough, stop. As I thought of that, I demand
first choice of cups.”</p>

<p>“All right,” conceded Madeline. “Second
maxim for travelers: When in doubt, drink
afternoon tea. I demand second choice of
cups.”</p>

<p>“I shall get third choice, anyway, shan’t
I?” said Babbie. “So I needn’t weary my
brains thinking of maxims.”</p>

<p>So Betty poured the tea, and Madeline told
fortunes for all the party in the grounds, after
which the smiling waitress appeared and asked
them how much bread they had eaten.</p>

<p>“I hated to own up to five pieces,” sighed
Babe, “not because I begrudged the beggarly
pence they cost, but because I am ashamed of
my appetite. Girls, there are more rooms
up-stairs.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have breakfast here to-morrow before
we go to Ayr,” suggested Betty. “Mrs.
Hildreth won’t be up early enough to eat
with us at the hotel, so we might just as well
come here.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Babbie. “Does the
man from Cook’s know when trains leave for
Ayr?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>He didn’t, and there was a rush to
find out and purchase tickets before dinner-time.</p>

<p>“I’m crazy to see Ayr,” said Babe the next
day. “I’m very fond of Burns’s poems, and
I can just imagine the sleepy, old-fashioned
little hamlet he was born in. His birthplace
and the haunted kirk and the bridges across
the Doon and all the other Burns relics are
out in the country, about two miles from the
station. Let’s buy some fruit and sweet chocolate
and eat our lunch on the way. It will
be a lovely walk, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Along English lanes, with tall hedgerows
on each side,” added Babbie dreamily.
“What a pity it’s too late for primroses.”</p>

<p>So great was their disappointment, when
the train stopped at Ayr, to find themselves
in a busy, prosperous, specklessly clean town,
with a paved square just back of the station,
where one was expected to sit and wait for the
tram that ran out to the birthplace of Robert
Burns once in ten minutes.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to do but take their old
tram, I suppose,” sighed Babe disconsolately.
“It’s no fun walking along a car-track.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Fancy this smug, bustling factory-town being
Ayr! Is all Europe fixed up like this, Madeline?”</p>

<p>Madeline assured her that it wasn’t, and
Babbie declared that if Oban was horrid and
new they would go straight to London by the
first train. “For there’s nothing horrid and
new about London,” she declared.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the house where
Burns was born, Babe objected again because
the thatched roof and the whitewashed walls
looked so new; but the churchyard was
beautiful and the “Auld Brig” picturesque,
and they were just beginning to enjoy themselves,
when two heavily-loaded trams came
up, and soon the place was swarming with
talkative Americans, most of them from the
same boat that the girls had crossed on.</p>

<p>“It’s a party,” explained Babe, when she
had escaped from the embraces of a pretty
young girl who had taken a fancy to her on
shipboard. “That fat man with spectacles
is the conductor. See them all gather around
him while he reads selections from Tam
O’Shanter. Goodness! Wouldn’t I hate to
do Europe with a bunch like that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s go back,” said Babbie sadly.
“Haven’t we seen everything?”</p>

<p>“And if we hurry we may get there in
time for tea at Miss Jelliff’s,” added Betty.
“There’s a room we haven’t been in yet, you
know.”</p>

<p>Babbie was very quiet all the way back.
As they took their places around the tea-table
she announced proudly, “Third maxim for
tourists: Avoid birthplaces. Now I can have
first choice of cups.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we ought to have a
maxim about avoiding conducted parties?”
asked Babe, helping herself to bread.</p>

<p>“No,” said Madeline decisively, “I don’t.
The kind of tourists that our maxims are intended
for would know better than that without
being told. Girls, do you want to know
what I’m going to do next year?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” chorused her three friends
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Start a fascinating tea-room like this in
either Harding or New York.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you were going to live in
Sorrento with your family.”</p>

<p>“Don’t all Bohemians have to be artists?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Then will you come back to America when
we do?”</p>

<p>Madeline laughed at the avalanche of questions.
“All good Bohemians are artists,” she
explained, “but not necessarily in paint.
You can be an artist in tea-rooms, too, you
know. I suppose I shall try to write more or
less, since my family seem to expect it of me,
but until I’ve made my everlasting reputation
as a short-story writer I should like to have a
steady source of income, which is a thing that
most Bohemians don’t have. Besides, think
what fun it would be buying the china.”</p>

<p>“It would be great,” declared Babbie solemnly.
“Don’t you want a partner, Madeline?”</p>

<p>Madeline laughed. “Wait until I’ve broken
the news to my family, Babbie. As I only
thought of it this afternoon, my ideas of what
I want&mdash;except this darling china&mdash;are somewhat
vague.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” persisted Babbie, “let’s
have tea-rooms for one of the dominant interests
of our trip. Don’t you remember in
one of Roberta’s books it says that every traveler
should have a dominant interest in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
to get the most profit and pleasure out of his
journey.”</p>

<p>“Well, what can the rest of us have?”
asked Betty, turning her teacup upside down
and twirling it around three times, ready for
Madeline to tell her fortune in the mystic
leaves.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get them as we go along, I guess,”
said Babbie easily. “I already know what
mine won’t be. It won’t be birthplaces.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth was much amused at the
story of the day’s disillusionments.</p>

<p>“It’s very hard nowadays to get away from
other American tourists,” she warned the girls.
“You mustn’t expect to have exclusive possession
of all these beautiful old pilgrimage
places.”</p>

<p>Babbie groaned. “Suppose that awful conducted
party should go up to Oban on the
boat with us.”</p>

<p>“If they should dare to do such a thing,
we’ll wait over a day,” Babe threatened savagely.</p>

<p>But no such drastic measures proved necessary.</p>

<p>“In spite of what your mother said, I verily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
believe we’re the only Americans on board,”
said Babe gleefully, as they swung out of
Greenock harbor next morning. It was a
glorious day, with fleecy white clouds scudding
across a blue sky and the sun turning
the sea to a sheet of sparkling silver. As they
got further out into the Firth of Clyde the
wind blew the clouds up over the sun and
wrapped the craggy islands in purple mists.
The scenery grew wilder and more magnificent
every moment, and the girls more enthusiastic.
Every time the boat stopped at a
pretty watering-place or a lonely fishing village,
Betty wished they could get off. “For
I don’t see how it can be any nicer than this
around Oban,” she said, “and what if it should
be like Ayr?”</p>

<p>But all day the purple headlands grew
bolder and more beautiful, and when at last
Oban came into view it proved to be the
crowning glory of the day’s trip. The crescent-shaped
bay had a great rock to guard it
on one side and an ivy-covered ruin on the
other. Between them the little town clung to
the hills above the sea, its villas almost hidden
among the trees, and a huge stone amphitheatre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
which the girls couldn’t even guess
the meaning of, crowning the highest slope.</p>

<p>Madeline had written ahead to “Daisybank
Villa,” so there was a boy to meet them at the
landing, take charge of their bags, and show
them the way up a steep, winding road, to the
house&mdash;such a pretty house, with roses climbing
around the door and real Scotch daisies
starring the turf of the tiny lawn.</p>

<p>“Oh, see the ‘daisies pied,’” cried Babe in
great excitement. “There’s more of Robert
Burns in this yard than there was in the whole
of that horrid old Ayr. Do let’s have dinner
right off, so we can go and explore.”</p>

<p>But dinner was at noon in “Daisybank
Villa,” so the pretty young housekeeper explained
apologetically. What they had now
was “tea,”&mdash;which meant bread and butter,
even nicer, if possible, than Miss Jelliff’s; hot
scones and bannocks&mdash;Babe demanded the
names of the blushing little waitress&mdash;the
nicest orange marmalade, fresh strawberries
smothered in thick cream, and tea with a
“cozy” to keep the pot warm.</p>

<p>But the real feature of the occasion was the
bell which one rang by getting up from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
table and pulling a heavy red tassel that hung
behind a curtain by the door.</p>

<p>“Exactly as they always do on the stage,”
said Babe in ecstasy, manfully resisting the
temptation to summon the waitress again just
for the fun of pulling the bell.</p>

<p>“And we’re living in lodgings in a villa by
the sea,” added Betty. “I feel like the heroine
of a Jane Austen novel, and I’m going to
write to Nan this very evening. She’ll be so
pleased to think that I’ve at last had a literary
sensation.”</p>

<p>After tea Babe and Madeline went out to
explore Oban, while Babbie helped Marie to
make Mrs. Hildreth’s room comfortable, and
Betty made a pretext of the letter to Nan to
wait for her.</p>

<p>When the four girls met half an hour later
on the promenade Madeline and Babe were
laughing over a little adventure they had had.</p>

<p>“We were walking along that road off
there,” Babe explained, “hurrying pretty fast,
because we wanted to go into that lovely ivy-covered
castle and be back here in time to
meet you. And as we passed two awfully
nice-looking youths, one said something to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
other in Dutch, and Madeline, having spent a
summer in Holland, understood it.”</p>

<p>“And translated it into the American idiom
for Babe’s benefit,” Madeline took her up, “as
‘Get on to their stride,’&mdash;never thinking, of
course, that the men also understood English.
But they did, because the one who had said
that in Dutch had the audacity to smile and
remark to his friend in Italian that we were
the first Americans he’d ever met who understood
Dutch.”</p>

<p>“And we couldn’t get into the ruin,” Babe
went on, “because the gate was locked, so we
came back and sat down here by the water to
watch the sunset. And by and by they
came back too, and that time they were talking
English&mdash;not for our benefit either, because
they didn’t see us.”</p>

<p>“Well, were they Americans after all?”
asked Babbie.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Madeline explained, “they were
Dutch, I suppose. The Dutch are great
linguists, you know.”</p>

<p>“They looked awfully jolly,” said Babe regretfully,
“especially the one who admired our
stride. If he’d been an American he’d have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
stopped and apologized for his rude remark,
and helped us climb the wall into the castle
gardens. It’s awfully high and it has broken
glass on top just like a story-book, and you
can go in only on Tuesdays and Fridays.”</p>

<p>“How disgusting for a castle to have at-home
days!” said Babbie. “I love ruins, and
we passed so many nice ones on the way up.
Isn’t there any other near Oban, man from
Cook’s?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find out in the morning,” Madeline
promised. “At present I feel more like bed.
It’s half-past nine, if it is broad daylight.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A RUIN AND A REUNION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning at breakfast Madeline
announced that she had found a ruined castle
for Babbie.</p>

<p>“The one with the ivy on it is Dunollie,”
she explained. “It belonged to the giant
Fingal once upon a time&mdash;he’s the giant that
had the cave out on one of those lovely purple
islands, you know. He must have either
lived in this castle, or visited here often, because
there is a stone in the yard that he used
to tie his dog to.”</p>

<p>“And who used to live in my castle?” inquired
Babbie, making a wry face as she tasted
the queer English coffee. “I don’t wonder
the English drink tea for breakfast rather
than this horrible stuff. I’m going to have
milk. Whose turn is it to ring the bell?
Now, Madeline,” when Betty had proudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
pulled the bell-cord, and taken her seat again,
“tell us all about my castle.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it,” said
Madeline, “except that it is named Dunstaffnage,
and it’s somewhere on the shore, a few
miles north of Oban. I presume our landlady
can tell us just how to get to it.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure it’s not on any tram-line?”
inquired Babbie anxiously. “I don’t want
the kind of ruin that’s on a tram-line, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not that kind,” Madeline assured
her. “You have to drive or walk to get
there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll walk, of course,” said Babe, and
everybody agreed, though their landlady assured
them it was a “right smart distance
awa’.”</p>

<p>“But ye’ll be all the hungrier for your dinner,”
she added comfortably. “What will ye
have for yer dinner?”</p>

<p>“Why, anything you like to give us,” said
Betty, to whom she had addressed her remark.</p>

<p>“Verra well. Lamb, perhaps, and strawberry
tartlets?”</p>

<p>“Strawberry tartlets for mine,” cried Babe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
throwing her tam-o’-shanter in the air. “We’ll
be back in time for strawberry tartlets, no
matter how good a time we’re having.”</p>

<p>So they started briskly off to find the
castle,&mdash;a merry party in tam-o’-shanters and
sweaters,&mdash;for the wind fairly whistled across
the moors, and it seemed more like November
than July, Betty said.</p>

<p>“That’s because Scotland is so far north,”
said Babe wisely. “The long twilights come
from that too. It’s almost like the land of the
midnight sun.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s certainly awfully cold,” said
Babbie. “Let’s race.”</p>

<p>So they raced down the hard white road till
they had reached the graveyard that their
landlady had named to them as a landmark.</p>

<p>“This must be the road she told us to take
across the fields,” said Babe, pointing to a
grassy track that turned off the highroad toward
the sea.</p>

<p>“I should call that a path, not a road,”
Madeline objected.</p>

<p>“I’ll go ahead and see if there’s any other
turning,” suggested Betty.</p>

<p>There didn’t seem to be any, so they took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the grassy path&mdash;or tried to. A little way
down it were some bars, and when they went
through them into the pasture an old black
cow rushed out from a clump of bushes and
ran at them fiercely with her head down.</p>

<p>Betty and Babbie screamed in terror and
scrambled back to the safe side of the fence;
Madeline followed them more deliberately,
and even Babe, the bold and fearless explorer
of cow-pastures, finally climbed to the top of
the fence, where she sat astride the highest
board to await developments. The cow
watched the retreat with interest and after a
few minutes wandered idly off to the grassy
spot where the rest of the herd were grazing.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Babe encouragingly, when
the cow’s back was safely turned. “She won’t
come at us again, I’m sure. If she does, I’ll
protect you. Hurry up, Madeline. We’ve got
to find the castle and get back in time for the
strawberry tartlets.”</p>

<p>So first Babe climbed down into the pasture,
then Madeline crawled through the bars,
with Babe after her and Betty bringing up
the rear. But no sooner had Betty pushed
safely through than the old black cow turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
her head, discovered what had happened, and
charged as fiercely as before.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Babe, from her perch
on the fence, “she wouldn’t really hurt us,
I’m sure of it. She’s just curious about us.
Cows are awfully curious animals.”</p>

<p>“She shows her curiosity in a very peculiar
way,” declared Babbie. “She doesn’t want
us in her pasture&mdash;that’s very evident.”</p>

<p>“Being a loyal Scotch cow, she objects to
an American invasion,” laughed Madeline.
“See her eating away as calmly as if we
didn’t exist. Let’s be awfully quiet getting
through this time and perhaps we can cut
across a corner of the pasture before she discovers
us.”</p>

<p>But they couldn’t. This time Betty was
the first one to follow the intrepid Babe into
the enemy’s country, and as soon as her head
appeared between the bars the old cow stopped
eating and came toward her. Then Babe had
an idea.</p>

<p>“It’s your red cap, Betty,” she cried. “Hide
it and see what happens.”</p>

<p>In nervous haste Betty pulled out her hatpins
and tucked the scarlet tam-o’-shanter out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
of sight under her white sweater. Whereupon
the black cow lowed amiably and
turned her head to nip a tempting tuft of
clover.</p>

<p>“Well, so that was what she wanted,” said
Babbie indignantly. “I supposed it was all
a myth about cows chasing red, didn’t you,
Babe?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” said Babe carelessly,
striding through the bushes. “Anyhow, I’m
mighty glad we’re off. We shall never find
your castle at this rate.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Betty reflectively,
“this is a real story-book country that we’re
in. Even the cows act as they do in story-books.”</p>

<p>“Well, the roads don’t,” objected Madeline.
“This one has come to a plain, unvarnished
end, as roads and other things have a way of
doing in real life. Why, it’s brought us right
down to the sea!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, they had come out on a strip
of sandy beach, with a little cluster of bath
houses at one end. A girl was standing in
the door of one of them.</p>

<p>“Go ask her the way, Madeline,” commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Babbie. “You’re the only one that
can remember the name of my castle.”</p>

<p>So Madeline went, and returned with the
news that they had taken the wrong turn at
the cemetery and must go back through the
pasture to the road on the hill.</p>

<p>“Never,” declared Babe firmly. “That cow
would have a chance to say, ‘I told you so.’
She was evidently trying to tell us that we
were on the wrong track. Didn’t you say the
castle was near the water? If so, why can’t
we go to it along the shore? It’s a lot prettier
down here.”</p>

<p>So Madeline interviewed the bath-house
girl again.</p>

<p>“She was very discouraging about it,”
she announced. “She said it was awfully
rough, with nothing but sheep-trails to
walk on, but we can try it if you all want
to.”</p>

<p>It was great fun walking on the sheep-trails
close by the edge of the sea, with the gorse
and heather that they had always read about
under their very feet, and the expectation of
seeing the castle as they rounded each headland.
But presently they came to a fence&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
high, close-meshed wire fence with a strand
of barbed wire on top.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it was meant to keep people
out, now doesn’t it?” said Babe cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Come and help me over,” called Babbie,
trying to dig her toes into the wire meshes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t trespassing a dreadful crime over
here?” asked Betty anxiously, when they had
all succeeded in getting over.</p>

<p>“Dreadful,” answered Madeline solemnly,
“but the cliffs are too steep to climb, and we
can’t go all the way back to the beach. Besides,
we haven’t any guns. Trespassers are
always supposed to be looking for game, I
think.”</p>

<p>Part of the way the sheep-trail led so near
to the water’s edge that it made Babbie dizzy,
and once they had to cross a rickety little
wooden bridge over a deep ravine and Betty
got over only by bravely shutting her eyes
and trying to believe Babe’s blithe assertion
that a good fat sheep, like those they saw on
the hillsides, must weigh almost as much as
a smallish girl. But the worst of it was, they
couldn’t find the castle.</p>

<p>“Lost: one perfectly good ruin, well off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
tram-lines,” chanted Babbie wearily. “The
cliffs aren’t steep here. Let’s climb up to the
highest point and see if we can’t find a farmhouse
where we can ask our way.”</p>

<p>But at the same moment that they discovered
the farmhouse they saw the castle&mdash;or
rather a thickly wooded point where Babe
was sure it was hidden, so they pushed
straight on without stopping to make inquiries.
A low stone wall separated the
wood from the moorland, and Babe was just
stepping over it, when she stopped and gave
a funny little exclamation.</p>

<p>“Our Dutchmen,” she said to Madeline.
“They must be the wardens of the castle.
Anyhow they’re camping in the wood.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go on?” inquired Babbie anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Madeline with decision.
“Baedeker would have told us if it hadn’t
been open to tourists. Come on, Babbie.”</p>

<p>The four had climbed the wall and were
walking demurely through the wood, politely
keeping as far as possible from the tent, when
Babbie happened to catch sight of Babe’s and
Madeline’s Dutchmen, who had been lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
comfortably on the ground in front of their
tent, and now were sitting up, apparently
quite absorbed in the books they were
reading.</p>

<p>“Dutchmen indeed!” said Babbie coolly.
“Why, it’s John Morton. Oh, Jackie Morton!”
she raised her voice. “What are you
doing camping out in the enchanted wood of
my castle?”</p>

<p>At this one of the campers dropped his
book, stared in the direction from which
Babbie’s voice had come, and jumping up
came quickly toward her.</p>

<p>“Well, this is funny,” he declared, wringing
her hand, “because I was just thinking
about the jolly summer we had up at Sunset
Lake and wishing the same old crowd was
here to tramp over the moors and picnic and
sail and have bully times together.”</p>

<p>Babbie laughed and introduced him to
Babe, Betty, and Madeline, and he, in his
turn, called to his companion to come and
meet everybody.</p>

<p>“It’s my tutor&mdash;Max Dwight,” he explained
hastily in an aside to Babbie. “He’s just out
of college himself, and he’s a mighty good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
sort, if he does try to keep me everlastingly
plugging. I say, Babbie, are you through
school yet?”</p>

<p>“Through college,” Babbie corrected him
with dignity. “We’re all Harding 19&mdash;’s.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” John’s face expressed deep concern.
“I’m scared. Girls frighten me to death anyhow,
and four B. A.’s! Let’s stroll off somewhere
by ourselves and talk.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed Babbie. “College
girls aren’t blue-stockings nowadays. Why
aren’t you a B. A. yourself, John? You were
going to be a junior the year after that summer
in the mountains.”</p>

<p>John nodded. “I got flunked out of my
class,” he explained carelessly. “I suppose
girls never get into that fix, but plenty of
fellows do,&mdash;bright ones at that.”</p>

<p>“Why, John Morton!” Babbie’s tone was
very scornful. “I didn’t think you were that
kind. Oh, yes, some Harding girls get
flunked out, but none of our crowd would.
We’ve got too much pride.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well to say,” John returned
sulkily. “You went to college because
you wanted to, I suppose. I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
because my father wanted to and couldn’t, so
he made me. I got as much fun out of it as
I could, and did as little work, and I don’t
care what you think about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do,” said Babbie coolly.
“You care a lot.” Then she smiled and held
out her hand. “Don’t let’s quarrel this
morning. If you look so glum the girls
will think all I’ve said about your being such
a jolly lot is a fairy-tale. I caught a glimpse
of you in Glasgow, you know, and I wanted
to climb down from the top of a two-story
tram to rush back and speak to you. But
the tram started just then and I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>John laughed. “Wanting to climb down
from the top of a tram to see a fellow is certainly
a proof of true friendship. We’ll have
our quarrel out some other day.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Babbie agreed, leading the way
back to the others. “But you’d better settle
your score with Babe and Madeline right
away.”</p>

<p>“Settle with Babe and Madeline,” repeated
John. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You’re really even,” Babbie pursued, not
wanting to embarrass John immediately after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
their reconciliation, “because if you commented
on their stride, they came home and
told Betty and me about meeting some Dutchmen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” John’s face lighted and then
he blushed, as he recognized Babe and Madeline.
“You were the ones we met on the
parade. I’m very sorry. So few people know
Dutch, and you were sprinting, you know.”</p>

<p>The girls declared that he was quite excusable,
but Babbie warned him that he wouldn’t
be safe in using even Bengali when Madeline
was around.</p>

<p>“And I shall have to be careful of you,”
said Madeline. “Where did you learn so
many languages, Mr. Morton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dad’s in an importing business with
branches all over the world, and his agents
sometimes come to New York. I like to go
down to the warehouses and talk to them, and
I can manage to say a little in ten different
languages. It’s positively my only accomplishment,”
added John modestly.</p>

<p>“And now please show us over my castle,”
Babbie demanded.</p>

<p>“May I ask by what right you claim the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
ownership of Dunstaffnage?” asked Mr.
Dwight laughingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wanted a ruin,” explained Babbie,
“and Madeline&mdash;Miss Ayres&mdash;picked this one
out for me. But I shan’t accept it unless it’s
a perfectly lovely one.”</p>

<p>“It is, though,” John assured her. “As far
as I know, it can’t be beaten anywhere in
Europe. How did you girls happen to come
in by the back way?”</p>

<p>“We were glad enough to get here by any
way,” laughed Babe. “Is this the back entrance,
and are you the wardens of it?”</p>

<p>“No, but we’re the proud possessors of a
permit from the owner to camp on his premises,”
said John. “We got tired of the Oban
hotels, and liked this beech-wood and the
castle so much that we wanted to board near
by. The people at the farm down the road
that you should have come by were willing to
feed us, but hadn’t any extra rooms, so I suggested
a tent&mdash;I camped all last summer up
in Canada&mdash;and here we are. If you’re going
to be lady of the castle, Babbie, you’ll have to
let us be its lords.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Babbie, leading the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
along a mossy path between the tall beeches.
Presently she gave an exclamation of dismay.
“Oh, but it’s such a very small castle! I
thought it would be big and have a rampart
and a moat.”</p>

<p>“That’s only the chapel, silly,” John explained.
“The castle is farther on.”</p>

<p>“A chapel! Oh, what a darling one!”
cried Betty. “I want the chapel for mine,
Babbie. You can have the castle.”</p>

<p>“I approve your taste, Miss Wales,” said
Mr. Dwight. “I think that little ivy-covered
ruin, hidden among the trees, is lovelier than
any castle. Come inside and see the stones.”</p>

<p>“Whose graves are they?” asked Betty,
following Mr. Dwight across the broken
threshold.</p>

<p>“They’re not legibly marked, except this
one. Some of the ancient owners of the castle,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Who did own it?” asked Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>“The old Scottish kings, first of all. They
held their court here for hundreds of years,
and kept the famous coronation stone here&mdash;the
one that’s now in Westminster Abbey&mdash;until
the Norwegians got to be too much for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
them and they moved the stone to Scone.
Then the Norwegians took Dunstaffnage, and
after them, their descendants, the Lords of
Argyll and Lorne. In Bruce’s time Alexander
of Argyll and his son John of Lorne were
bitter enemies of the king and almost overthrew
him. But Bruce conquered John in
the Pass of Brander, close by here, and shut
up old Alexander in his own castle. So the
family lost their lands to the crown, though
they lived on here for over a century longer,
and James, Earl of Douglas, met the heads of
the family here and tried to induce them to
join his cause. In more modern times Flora
Macdonald was imprisoned here for helping
bonnie Prince Charlie to outwit his enemies
and escape to France.”</p>

<p>“How interesting!” said Betty eagerly.
“It just gives you thrills to think that you’re
standing on such historic ground, doesn’t it?
Now I want to see the castle.”</p>

<p>While Betty and Mr. Dwight had been
talking in the chapel, Babbie had hurried the
others through the wood and around to the
front of the castle where the entrance was.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t have doorways on the side
toward the sea,” John explained, “because the
enemy would have come in small boats, crept
up through the wood in the dark, and surrounded
them.”</p>

<p>“We can go inside, can’t we?” asked Babbie
eagerly, and by the time Betty appeared,
Babbie and John were perched on the narrow
ledge that ran almost all the way around the
top of the crumbling castle wall.</p>

<p>“It’s great!” Babbie cried to the rest, making
a trumpet of her hands. “You can see
ever so far. Come up, all of you!”</p>

<p>So the rest, who had dropped down on the
grass to rest after their long walk, climbed the
narrow, steep stone stairway and emerged on
the ledge.</p>

<p class="p2b">As Babbie had said, it was “great” up there.
The castle stood on a promontory at the mouth
of a beautiful loch&mdash;which, as the girls had
already discovered on their way up to Oban,
often means simply an arm of the sea, of
which, owing to the irregularity of the coastline,
there are a great many in Scotland. You
could see far up the loch in one direction and
out to the open sea in the other, and in the
background loomed great, mist-shrouded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
peaks, wild and terrible, with stretches of

<p class="caption">“COME UP, ALL OF YOU”</p>

<p class="p2">“What is this?” asked Babe, pointing to a
rusty iron standard fastened to the top of the
castle’s sea-wall.</p>

<p>“That’s a beacon-holder,” Mr. Dwight told
her. “In the good old days of the Border
Wars, this castle used to be a station in the
chain of signal fires. They fastened a bundle
of fagots into that frame and set them on fire,
and the chief in the castle over there on one
of those purple islands, and the clan gathered
on the slope of Ben Cruachan, that highest
peak up at the head of the loch, saw the fire,
and knew what it meant.”</p>

<p>“What did it mean?” demanded Babe.</p>

<p>“Different things at different times,” explained
Mr. Dwight, “but generally death
and pillage for somebody.”</p>

<p>Babbie gave a little sigh of satisfaction.
“How lovely! I accept my castle, Madeline,
with many thanks. I wish it had some rooms
down-stairs to explore, and a dungeon, but it’s
very nice just as it is. It’s so absolutely unspoiled.”</p>

<p>“It certainly doesn’t look much like that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
dreadful cottage at Ayr,” laughed Betty.
“Did you go to Ayr, Mr. Morton?”</p>

<p>John nodded. “Silly little place, isn’t it?
I say, Babbie, there is one thing that this castle
lacks. Dwight and I were talking about
it this morning before you came. Don’t you
know what it is?”</p>

<p>Babbie considered, frowning. “No, I don’t,
and it isn’t nice of you to pick flaws in my
castle, John.”</p>

<p>“I’m not picking flaws,” retorted John.
“I’m just calling your attention to any little
defects I’ve noticed, so that you won’t accept
your castle in ignorance and live to repent
your rash act later. Can’t any of you guess
what I mean?”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Madeline promptly. “It
ought to have a ghost. No castle is complete
without one. But are you perfectly sure this
hasn’t any?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it hasn’t,” said John solemnly.
“We’ve been here three nights now, and no
ghost has walked so far. Besides I consulted
the family who live in the farm attached to
the castle, and they stoutly deny the existence
of a ghost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but that doesn’t prove anything,” declared
Madeline. “Don’t you know that the
lords of the castle and their retainers always
deny the existence of a ghost? They regard
it as a blemish on the property.”</p>

<p>“How absurd of them,” sighed Babbie.
“Oh, dear, now that you’ve mentioned it, I
do want my castle to have a ghost, and I believe
it has one, too. Who knows about the
history of Dunstaffnage? Wasn’t anybody
ever murdered here, or didn’t some beautiful
lady pine away for love? Those are the most
likely kinds of ghosts, aren’t they, Madeline?”</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “When we get back to
Oban, we’ll try to find a history of the castle
and perhaps we can unearth a ghost for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dwight!” Betty and Mr. Dwight
held a whispered conference, then she turned
to Babbie.</p>

<p>“We’ve thought of a ghost for you. Her
name is Flora Macdonald. She was imprisoned
here once, because she had tried to help
bonnie Prince Charles to escape, after there
was a price set on his head.”</p>

<p>“And now she walks in the beech-wood?”
asked Babbie eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Betty looked questioningly at Mr. Dwight.
“She ought to,” he said laughingly, “since the
fair lady of the castle wishes it. I’ll inquire
more particularly of the farm people and let you
know next time you pay a visit to your domain.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to be going back now,”
said Babbie regretfully, leaving her comfortable
perch on the castle-wall.</p>

<p>“I should think so. We’ve forgotten the
strawberry tartlets,” cried Babe in tragic tones.
“It’s half-past twelve now, and our dinner is
at one.”</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly make it,” said John.
“You’d better stay and have a bite with us at
the farm. It isn’t elegant, but everything
tastes good, and you must be famished.”</p>

<p>“We are,” sighed Madeline.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to go back for our own dinner,”
declared Babe sternly. “Miss MacNish
suggested the tartlets on purpose to please us,
you know, and it wouldn’t be nice of us not
to go back. It’s only three miles by road, Mr.
Morton says, so we ought to be there by a
quarter past one.”</p>

<p>“You won’t even stop for a drink of milk?”
urged John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Babbie shook her head. “It would take
too long. Come and see us, John, and you
too, Mr. Dwight. We’re at Daisybank Villa.
I don’t know the street, but you can ask.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find it all right,” John assured
her. “I say, can’t we take some trips together,
or some tramps?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Babbie promised him, hurrying
after the others. “We’ll arrange it when
you come.”</p>

<p>John looked after the party admiringly.
“I like their spirit,” he said to Mr. Dwight,
“going back so as not to disappoint their landlady.
Babbie Hildreth is always like that&mdash;just
as fair and square as any fellow you can
name. She’s jolly too&mdash;if she did graduate
from college. I say, Dwight, I’m much
obliged to you for giving me the morning off,
and I’ll make up for it this afternoon, sure
enough.”</p>

<p>Which was such an unprecedentedly docile
attitude on the part of John Morton that his
bewildered tutor hoped Babbie Hildreth and
her friends would continue to stay in Oban
and exercise their beneficent influence.</p>

<span class="smaller">SCOTCH MISTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day it rained&mdash;a dismal, drizzling
sort of rain that acted as if it never meant to
stop.</p>

<p>“I suppose this is a Scotch mist,” said Babe
dolefully at breakfast. “Of course we ought
to enjoy it, as an experience of real Scotch
weather, but for my part I prefer a good rattling
American rain-storm.”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t want to take another long
walk to-day, even if it were pleasant,” said
Betty consolingly. “I shouldn’t at least.
Sprinting home after the strawberry tarts
made me horribly lame.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” sighed Babbie. “Also it made
a hole in my shoe&mdash;the only pair I have that
are right for rough walking.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put on rain-coats and go hunting a
cobbler,” proposed Madeline.</p>

<p>“And a history of Dunstaffnage,” added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Babbie. “I asked Miss MacNish if there was
a library in Oban and she said no; so we shall
have to find a book-store.”</p>

<p>“We can buy post-cards too,” put in Betty.
“This is just the right kind of day for writing
letters.”</p>

<p>So they tramped blithely down the hill and
wandered in more leisurely fashion along
Oban’s one business street.</p>

<p>“There’s a shoe-shop,” announced Babe
presently. “And it says in the window ‘Repairing
done while you wait.’”</p>

<p>“Goodie!” exclaimed Madeline. “Then I
shall have my sole patched, too. It’s worn
terribly thin on these stony Scotch roads.”</p>

<p>The smiling saleswoman showed the girls
into a tiny back room, where Madeline could
sit while she waited “with one shoe off and
one shoe on.” Babbie stayed to keep her
company, and Babe and Betty went off to buy
post-cards, promising to come back before long
with sweet chocolate for the captives.</p>

<p>“This looks like a book-store,” said Babe,
stopping before a little shop with magazines
in the window. “We might inquire about
the history of Babbie’s castle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>A severe-looking, heavily bearded old gentleman
came out from a back room to meet them.
No, this was not a book-shop, he explained
gruffly; it was a stationer’s; there were two
book-shops at the other end of the esplanade.</p>

<p>Just then Betty caught sight of some post-cards.
“Oh, what lovely cards!” she cried.
“Here’s one of Dunollie, and one of Dunstaffnage,
and oh&mdash;here’s that lovely gray
beach that we came down to from the black
cow’s pasture. Caernavan Sands is its name.
Doesn’t that sound romantic?”</p>

<p>“My cairds are hand-teented,” said the old
stationer in broad Scotch. “They are tuppence
ha’ penny each. Not that it mak’s ony
deeference to you, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Tuppence ha’ penny,” repeated Babe meditatively.
“That’s five cents&mdash;cheap enough
for hand-colored ones, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Betty picked out the cards she wanted from
the rack, and then noticed more piles behind
the counter.</p>

<p>“Oh, are there some others back there?”
she asked. “May I see them, please?”</p>

<p>The old gentleman said something which
Betty mistook for permission to go behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
counter and look; but as she started to do so
he barred her way.</p>

<p>“No, no, madam,” he said sternly. “You
can go wherever you like in your own
country, but in my shop you stay where you
belong.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” said Betty meekly.
“I thought you said I might see them. I’m
very, very sorry.”</p>

<p>“I said I wad bring ye the ones that were
deeferent from those in the rack,” said the
old man, glaring at poor Betty from under
his beetling eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Let’s not buy his old cards,” muttered
Babe indignantly in Betty’s ear.</p>

<p>But Betty smiled and shook her head.
“They’re too pretty to lose,” she whispered.
“We should be just spiting ourselves.”</p>

<p>By this time the old Scotchman seemed to
be a little mollified, and condescended to ask
the girls what trips they had taken from Oban
and to show them some views of Glencoe, a
beautiful mountain pass, and of Iona, the
island where Saint Columba’s church is, both
of which he recommended them to visit.
Babe listened in sulky silence, leaving Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
to answer his questions and thank him for
his advice.</p>

<p>“Come again, leedies,” he said, as they went
out, and Betty thanked him politely for that,
too.</p>

<p>“Hateful old thing!” cried Babe, when
they were once more outside. “The idea of
talking that way to us, just because we’re
Americans. What has he got against America,
I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“Never mind him,” said Betty soothingly.
“His post-cards are perfectly lovely. Now
let’s get the sweet chocolate for those poor
hungry girls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what fascinating little cakes,” cried
Babe rapturously, stopping before a pastry-cook’s
window. “Don’t you suppose they’d
rather have those than just ordinary sweet chocolate?
It would be such fun buying them.”</p>

<p>“It’s fun buying anything over here with
this queer English money,” laughed Betty.
“Doesn’t it seem to you just like toy money,
Babe?”</p>

<p>Babe nodded. “And when I spend it I
don’t feel as if I were spending real money at
all. It’s the loveliest feeling that whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
you buy doesn’t matter a bit, as long as toy
money will pay for it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s buy four of the buns and three of the
chocolaty ones and an odd one for you, because
you don’t like chocolate,” said Betty,
returning to the cakes.</p>

<p>They got back to the shoe-shop, with their
bag of cakes, just in time to find Madeline
tying on her mended shoe.</p>

<p>“Let’s save the cakes till we get home,”
she proposed. “We can eat them while we’re
reading about Flora Macdonald. Oh, let me
see your post-cards. What beauties! Show
us where they came from, this minute.”</p>

<p>“All right, only prepare to be insulted if
you go inside,” said Babe, and she told the
story of their experience.</p>

<p>“Crusty old party, isn’t he?” said Madeline.
“Oh, I know what! I can do a beautiful
English accent. I’ll go in and make him
think I’m English. Then he’ll talk to me
confidentially about America.”</p>

<p>“But then I shan’t have any cards,” objected
Babbie forlornly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll bring you some,” Madeline
promised her. “Wait for me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“In that Scotch plaid store over there,”
supplied Babe, who never let an interesting
shop escape her notice.</p>

<p>There were golf capes in the store, tweed
ulsters&mdash;“Just the thing for a Scotch mist,”
said Babbie, shivering in her natty silk rain-coat&mdash;beautiful
little kilted suits for small
boys to wear, and best of all, a proprietor
resplendent in full Scotch regalia&mdash;kilted skirt,
“golf” stockings, green coat, and the insignia of
his clan dangling from a belt around his waist.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything so gorgeous,”
murmured Babbie under her breath. “These
plaid silk squares will make lovely bags, girls.
I’m going to buy a Macdonald one, in
memory of Flora. I do hope she will turn
out to be the ghost of my castle.”</p>

<p>So Babbie timidly approached the majestic
figure in plaids, who bowed affably and did
up the silk square as neatly as any ordinary
salesman, talking pleasantly meanwhile about
the rain and the war-ship that had appeared
that morning in the harbor.</p>

<p>The transaction was barely completed when
Madeline came back, laden with post-cards
and bursting with merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“I took him in completely,” she said.
“He told me all about you two and how you
acted as if you owned Oban and his shop, and
how the Americans are all millionaires and
are spoiling the town, running about everywhere,
asking senseless questions and not
respecting any one’s privacy.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he have enjoyed seeing us get over
that chicken-wire fence?” said Babe viciously.</p>

<p>“And wouldn’t he be wild if he heard
Babbie refer to Dunstaffnage as her castle?”
added Betty.</p>

<p>“Well, as an impartial person who hasn’t
seen him,” put in Babbie, “I think there’s a
good deal in his ideas. Lots of American
tourists are frights. Wouldn’t you be mad,
if you lived in Ayr, to see them swarming
around the Burns relics and turning the town
into pandemonium every pleasant day all
summer?”</p>

<p>“I certainly should,” admitted Babe, “but
all the same I wouldn’t be rude about it. I’d
move away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but perhaps you couldn’t,” began
Betty seriously. “If you were old, you
know, and your business was there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Whereupon the other three burst into peals
of laughter at her earnestness, and couldn’t
sober down even at the prospect of scandalizing
the bookseller as much as they had the
crabbed old stationer. But the bookseller
proved to be a brisk young fellow with an eye
for trade, and no national prejudices. He sold
them two paper-covered guides to the region
around Oban, which, he assured them, would
tell them all about Flora Macdonald, and all
about Dunstaffnage castle as well. He too
had post-cards, and Babe bought some, “on
principle,” she explained, because he was so
very agreeable to Americans.</p>

<p>After dinner it rained harder than ever, so
the girls gathered in Miss MacNish’s parlor,
the use of which, they had discovered, went
with “lodgings.” They had exhausted the
guide-books, written on most of their post-cards,
decided to go to Iona on the first
pleasant day, if there ever was one, and were
beginning to feel very dull indeed, when
Miss MacNish’s funny little maid appeared to
say that there were two gentlemen down-stairs;
and should she bring them right up?</p>

<p>“It’s John and Mr. Dwight, of course,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Babbie gleefully. “Isn’t it jolly of them to
come all this way through the rain to see us?”</p>

<p>“We got drowned out,” John explained.
“It’s the first rain since we began to camp,
and we found it most horribly wetting. So
we folded our tent like the Arabs, silently
stole with it to the farmer’s barn, and took up
our quarters at the hotel nearest Daisybank
Villa. And here we are.”</p>

<p>“Wad ye like an early tea for your friends?”
inquired Miss MacNish, smilingly appearing
in the doorway; and Babbie said yes, if it
was perfectly convenient.</p>

<p>“We were hoping you’d ask us to tea,” confessed
Mr. Dwight laughingly. “We’ve become
horribly bored with each other’s society,
haven’t we, J.?”</p>

<p>“And we were getting bored with ours,” retorted
Madeline. “A rainy day is a dreadful
strain on the tourist’s temper, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think it’s going to clear
up to-morrow?” demanded John anxiously.
“Because if it does, and if Mrs. Hildreth
doesn’t object, we were hoping you’d go on
some sort of excursion with us.”</p>

<p>“How jolly!” cried Babbie, and suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Iona. But the men had been there, and John
objected to going anywhere in a crowd.</p>

<p>“What I meant was to go off somewhere
just as we did that summer in the woods, not
looking for scenery or for storied castles, but
just for a jolly good time and a good tramp&mdash;or
a drive if you girls prefer that.”</p>

<p>Babbie twisted her face into an expression
of puzzled amusement. “Oh, John Morton,
you are so funny,” she gasped. “You mean
you want to forget you’re in Scotland and
pretend you’re in America, so you can go on
a plain American picnic.”</p>

<p>“I object to plain,” said John promptly.
“I insist on having extra-super eats on any
picnic that I honor with my presence. Stop
laughing, Babbie. I don’t see anything so
funny in wanting to go on a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Well, probably there isn’t,” admitted Babbie,
“only I never went on one before in Europe,
and I never heard of any one else who
did. But I think it will be great fun.”</p>

<p>“And that’s what we’re here for,” added
Madeline promptly. “We’re not the kind of
tourists who bore themselves with solid days
of ruins and museums and galleries that they’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
never think of visiting if they were in New
York. We hope to improve our minds when
it’s perfectly agreeable, but we’re all against
cramming.”</p>

<p>“Why, Madeline Ayres,” cried Betty eagerly,
“you know you were the worst crammer
in 19&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“The best, you mean, my child,” Madeline
corrected her. “Well, now that I’m a full-fledged
B. A., I see the error of my ways, and
I am resolved not to cram on the British
museum when we get to it.”</p>

<p>“Everybody stop disputing,” commanded
Babe, “and decide about the eats.”</p>

<p>“Let’s cook something,” suggested Madeline.
“I hate cold luncheons.”</p>

<p>“It’s just the weather for a bacon-bat,” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“Then let’s have one by all means,” Mr.
Dwight seconded her. “I don’t know what
it is, but it certainly sounds appetizing.”</p>

<p>“It’s great,” Babe assured him. “You
roast the bacon on sticks, and have rolls and
pickles and things to go with it, and coffee,
of course. We used to have them all winter
in Harding when it wasn’t too snowy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said John, “a bacon-bat it
shall be. We’ll get the things in the morning
when we start off. Now the next question
is, shall we walk or ride?”</p>

<p>“Let’s walk,” said Babe. “We’re all crazy
over walking. Unless&mdash;would your mother
go if we rode, Babbie?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hildreth, who appeared just then,
having heard from Miss MacNish about the
early tea, said she was sure that even if it
cleared off in the morning it would be too
damp for her idea of a picnic, so it was finally
decided to walk.</p>

<p>As soon as tea was over, John declared that
he must go. “Got to bone this evening to
make up for taking part of to-morrow morning
off,” he explained, blushing and looking
sheepishly at Mr. Dwight.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see that you pay in advance
for your fun, John,” said Mrs. Hildreth. “It’s
the best way.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Mrs. Hildreth,” said
John. “Anyhow I’m experimenting on it
just at present. We’ll be here at eleven sharp,
Babbie.”</p>

<p>Next morning every one of the girls got up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
long before Daisybank’s breakfast hour to
have a look at the weather. At least it wasn’t
raining, and the sun might come out by eleven.</p>

<p>“Besides, who cares for the weather?” inquired
Babe calmly, lacing up her heaviest
shoes. “We can’t waste another day moping
around indoors.”</p>

<p>“We’d better take the ‘last resorts’ though,”
said Betty. “The wood will all be wet.”</p>

<p>“Lucky mother insisted on bringing two of
them,” said Babbie. “Now we can have one
for the bacon and one for the coffee.”</p>

<p>The sun wasn’t shining at eleven; indeed
the sky was very gray, and John and Mr.
Dwight looked dubious as they turned in
at Daisybank Villa. But they were pleasantly
disappointed at finding the four girls arrayed
in sweaters and tam-o’-shanters, all ready to
start.</p>

<p>“We’ve bought the lunch, too,” explained
Babe, thrusting a bulky parcel into John’s
arms. “We thought we shouldn’t have any
too much time to get well out into the country
before it was time to eat.”</p>

<p>When they had gone about two miles across
the moors, John, who was ahead with Betty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
stopped short. “Did you make it a bacon-bat?”
he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Betty.</p>

<p>“Weren’t we elected to make it that?”
asked Madeline.</p>

<p>“Then we shall starve,” declared John
tragically. “Look at your skirts. How are
we going to make a fire with everything dripping
wet like this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that your trouble!” Babe gave a
sigh of relief, which the others echoed. “Why,
we’ve brought the ‘last resorts’ along. You
don’t know what they are, do you? It’s private
Harding slang. Let’s camp on the top
of that lovely steep cliff, with the purple
heather on top of it, and then we’ll show you
about ‘last resorts.’”</p>

<p>So they settled themselves on the rocks,
Babe produced the two chafing-dish lamps,
and a flask of alcohol from somewhere inside
her sweater,&mdash;she and Bob always tucked
things away in mysterious places to leave their
hands free,&mdash;and Mr. Dwight obligingly held
the coffee-pot over one lamp, while Babbie
arranged the table on a flat rock, and the rest
threaded thin slices of bacon on to pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
sticks and squabbled merrily for a chance to
hold them near the flame of the other lamp.
Miss MacNish had given them scones instead
of rolls, and raspberry tartlets for dessert, so
it wasn’t quite an American picnic after all.
But it was a perfectly satisfactory one, John
declared.</p>

<p>“Are all Harding girls like your crowd?”
he asked Babe on the way home.</p>

<p>Babe considered laughingly. “How do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, jolly, and up to things, not minding
if you get your skirts wet going ’cross
country, and knowing about ‘last resorts,’
and all that.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course we always thought we were
a little jollier than any other crowd,” Babe
explained modestly. “We called ourselves
‘The Merry Hearts,’ you know, and we had
all the fun there was going, I guess&mdash;especially
Bob Parker and Babbie and I.”</p>

<p>John’s face darkened suddenly. “I thought
from something Babbie said&mdash;did you go in
hard for honors and all that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Babe sturdily. “I just
managed to keep along. I’m not a bit clever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
you see, but the others are&mdash;except Betty, perhaps,
and she was always right up in her work.
Helen Adams and Madeline were prods. in
lit. and themes, and Eleanor Watson was
fine in everything after she settled down to
work. Babbie was the brightest kind of a star
in the languages, and Bob and K. Kittredge
were in all the scientific societies. Oh, and
Roberta Lewis was a wonderful actress and
Rachel Morrison was considered the best all-around
student in 19&mdash;. Everybody but me
was in Clio or Dramatic Club.”</p>

<p>“I think you were wise to stay out,” said
John carelessly. “I don’t believe in killing
yourself with work, just for a few empty
honors.”</p>

<p>“Empty honors!” Babe’s brown eyes
flashed. “Do you think honors are empty
in a girl’s college? I should like to have
been a star too, I can tell you. I never got
a condition, but once I was warned and I
had several low-grades. I was just awfully
ashamed of them. I hate messing things.”
Babe paused, suddenly remembering that
Babbie had said vaguely that Mr. Dwight
was coaching John Morton for some examinations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and that John had spoken of having
work to do. “I hope I haven’t hurt your
feelings,” she murmured. “Babbie said you
were studying&mdash;you said&mdash;well, anyhow I
never thought that maybe you’d flunked some
courses. I’m sorry. Call it quits for what
you said about my walk, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were even for that already.
How about having thought I was a Dutchman?”</p>

<p>“I never,” said Babe laughingly. “That
was Madeline. I’ve never seen a Dutchman
that I know of, so I couldn’t think either
way.”</p>

<p>“All right then. Anyhow I don’t mind
your saying what you think. Yes, I did
flunk&mdash;got to do senior year over again.
You see I went with a crowd of fellows who
were just there for the fun of it, and I got
careless and began coaching too late. I believe
you’re right about messing things.”</p>

<p>“John, Miss Hildreth wants to see her
castle by moonlight,” called Mr. Dwight.
“Do you think we could arrange it?”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s nothing to hinder if the
moon’s willing&mdash;she is, isn’t she? Unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Mrs. Hildreth objects, at least. We could
drive out right after tea, or we could drive
out in the afternoon and have tea there.
What do you say, Babbie?”</p>

<p>Babbie refused to be interested in tea.
“I’m hoping my ghost will walk,” she explained.
“I don’t think you gave her a fair
trial. Ghosts prefer to walk by moonlight;
it’s so much more becoming.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go day after to-morrow,” said
Mr. Dwight. “That’s the night for a full
moon.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll give the ghost the fairest kind
of a fair trial,” added Madeline, and immediately
engaged in a low-toned conversation
with Mr. Dwight, who was convulsed with
merriment at something she told him. The
two kept quite by themselves all the rest of
the way home, and when Babe demanded to
know the joke, they only smiled mysteriously
and said it would take too long to explain.</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Will</span> I chaperon a moonlight expedition
to your castle? Babbie dear, what mad
scheme will you think of next?”</p>

<p>Babbie gave her mother a loving little hug.
“I didn’t think of it all by myself&mdash;we all
thought of it together, including John and
Mr. Dwight. Isn’t it a nice idea, mummie?
Aren’t you crazy to see your daughter’s castle
by the witching light of the full moon?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth laughed and hugged Babbie.
“I certainly am. It’s extremely interesting
to have a castle in the family. You’re sure
you’re not finding Oban dull, girls? I’m
quite rested now from the voyage, and we
can go on to London and Paris as fast as
you like.”</p>

<p>“Oban dull!” echoed four amazed voices.</p>

<p>“Why, mummie, it’s perfectly splendid!”
Babbie explained eagerly. “You must come
with us this morning and see the cottages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
back behind the hill&mdash;they’re just smothered
in honeysuckle. And yesterday we found
where the shooting that we hear so often
comes from. There’s a target back there, and
funny little soldiers in plaids&mdash;think of fighting
real battles in kilts, mummie!&mdash;shoot at it
every afternoon.”</p>

<p>“And Sunday Mr. MacNish is going to
take us to a Gaelic service at the Free Kirk,”
put in Betty. “He’s lent Madeline a Gaelic
primer, so she can learn to say good-morning
to the people at the church in their own old-time
language.”</p>

<p>“This is an open day for Fingal’s castle,”
suggested Madeline. “Mrs. Hildreth ought
to see that, so she can compare it with yours,
Babbie.”</p>

<p>“Come on, dear. Get your hat this very
minute,” Babbie commanded. “When you’re
traveling with four B. A.’s you can’t waste
time.”</p>

<p>“‘B. A.’s Abroad’&mdash;wouldn’t that be a nice
title for the journal Madeline is keeping for
us?” suggested Babe. “It’s so&mdash;so&mdash;what
do you call a thing that sounds like that?”</p>

<p>“Alliterative,” answered Betty promptly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
“I looked up that word in the fall of freshman
year because Mary Brooks said it about
Katherine Kittredge of Kankakee.”</p>

<p>“But if we have that title,” objected
Babbie, “we shall have to live up to it. I
read over the Glasgow chapter last evening,
and it sounds pretty frivolous for B. A.’s.”</p>

<p>“Frivolous!” sighed Madeline, “when I
put in all Babe’s lofty sentiments about the
poetry of Burns, and a whole paragraph on
our interest in Gothic architecture. Besides,
why shouldn’t we be frivolous now and then?
Nobody can accuse us of not seeing what’s to
be seen, and think how industriously we’ve
read up on Flora Macdonald.”</p>

<p>“For fun,” objected Babe.</p>

<p>“If you can make play out of work you’ve
learned the art of true happiness,” declared
Madeline. “Isn’t that the gospel of Bohemia
and of Harding, as I’ve been expounding it
for four long and weary years? By the way,
Mr. Dwight said he might be up this afternoon,
so I suppose I’d better not go out until
later.”</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Dwight are getting awfully
chummy,” said Babe. But it was no fun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
teasing Madeline about men, because she
never cared enough even to listen to what
one was saying. Now she answered coolly
that it was lucky Mr. Dwight hadn’t made
his announcement more general, since it had
turned out to be such a perfect afternoon for
a walk. After the rest were safely out of the
way she went to find Miss MacNish, who
looked very much amazed when Madeline
explained what articles she wanted, but got
them for her all the same, and helped her do
them up into a neat parcel, which Mr. Dwight
smuggled out through the garden just as the
others were coming in by the front gate.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the next afternoon John
drew up the finest pair of horses to be hired
in Oban with a grand flourish in front of
Daisybank Villa, and Mr. Dwight helped
Mrs. Hildreth and the girls to climb into the
high seats of the trap, while Miss MacNish
stowed away a tea-basket and all sorts of
inviting looking boxes and bundles under
their feet.</p>

<p>“Do ye ken that all American lassies
are like these?” she asked her little maid,
as they stood at the gate waving a farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
to the picnickers. “They’re verra nice lodgers&mdash;but
they do take some crazy notions,”
she added grimly, remembering Madeline’s
confidence of the afternoon before.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we have plenty of time to-day,”
said Babbie, with a little sigh of satisfaction,
when, after a brisk drive, they drew up in
the castle yard. “I want to go all through
the beech-wood, and climb down the cliffs
to the edge of the water, and sit on the
parapet and imagine that I’m a Norwegian
princess waiting for her lover who’s coming
from across the sea in a little boat with a
white sail.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, how romantic!” sniffed Babe.
“Where are we going to have tea?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hildreth, you decide that,” said John.
“When you’ve chosen a spot we’ll pile the
baskets and things near it, and then I’m
going back to the farm to get an armful of
wood for the signal-fire. Your forest is too
well kept, Babbie. There are no twigs on
the ground for the convenience of the ship-wrecked
mariner who wants to signal the
nearest dwelling for help. It’s a shame.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ayres and I will get your wood,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
suggested Mr. Dwight. “I’ve promised to
take her to the farm to see if any of the
family knows how to speak Gaelic.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed John. “I’m not a bit
keen for carrying wood. Be sure you bring
enough, though; we want a rattling big signal,
you know. Now Mrs. Hildreth, let me show
you the chapel.”</p>

<p>It was a delightful go-as-you-please picnic.
Babe went wading in a pool after sea-anemones.
Betty lay on a sunny slope dreaming
of all the good times she had been having
and was going to have all summer. Madeline
and Mr. Dwight sat on the parapet and
quarreled amicably over the right way to
“lay” a signal-fire. Babbie and John conducted
Mrs. Hildreth over the castle domain,
and when she was tired they decorated
the tea-table&mdash;a slab of rock on a sunny
slope by the sea&mdash;with sprays of white
heather, which is supposed always to bring
good luck to those who wear it. After tea
they all sat together watching the sunset,
while Madeline told them a quaint folk-tale
that an old grannie at the farmhouse had
told her, all about ghosts and fairies and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
gnomes who lived on the islands in the
firth.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t answer when we asked her
about a ghost for this castle,” Madeline added
solemnly. “She just shook her head and
muttered something about ‘trailing white
robes.’ Just then her daughter came in with
the wood, and the old woman shut up like a
clam. The daughter thinks Gaelic and ghosts
are all rubbish.” Madeline stood up. “It
must be lovely on the parapet now.”</p>

<p>“It’s lovely here,” said Babe dreamily, and
the party broke up again.</p>

<p>So it happened that Babe, who was the last
to leave the shadowy beech-wood, was alone
down by the little chapel when she saw the
ghost. It was quite across the wood by the
wall, when she first noticed it, and in the dusk
she thought of course it was Babbie, who was
wearing a white serge suit and a big white
hat.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming to watch the moon rise
with the others?” Babe called to her. But
the figure didn’t answer, only came slowly
nearer, groping its way uncertainly among the
tree trunks. Presently Babe noticed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
white dress it wore hung in long, loose folds
around it, quite differently from Babbie’s suit,
that it was much taller than she, and that it
carried something dark in one outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a trick of the others. They know I’m
here alone, and they’ve sent Madeline down
to scare me,” Babe reflected indignantly.</p>

<p>“I know you now, Miss Madeline Ghost,”
she called across to the figure, “so you may
as well take off that white shawl of Mrs. Hildreth’s
and come with me to the parapet to
see the moon rise.”</p>

<p>The ghostly figure was quite near now, but
if it was Madeline it had no intention of letting
Babe know it. It came on silently to
within a few paces of where she stood waiting,
and then suddenly and without warning a
pitiful little moaning cry broke the stillness
of the wood,&mdash;a sound like the stifled, smothered
sobbing of some one in terrible anguish.</p>

<p>Babe listened for a minute to the gruesome
moaning. Then, “Oh, I say, that’s too much,”
she protested indignantly. “You’re giving
me the creeps, Madeline Ayres, honestly you
are. Please stop.” There was real terror in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Babe’s appeal, but the ghost paid no heed.
The moaning went on softly, incessantly, just
as before.</p>

<p>Babe hesitated a moment longer, and then,
pocketing her pride, she fled up the path to
the castle. Out of the wood she ran, across
the grassy slope, and up the winding stone
stairs, as if she thought the ghost was close
behind her. Near the top of the flight she
paused for breath. “Don’t care if they did
see me,” she muttered angrily, brushing the
hair out of her face and assuring herself that
the ghost had not followed. “It’s a mean trick
to scare any one like that. It’s dangerous,
really it is.” But they hadn’t seen her mad
race through the wood. Apparently they
hadn’t even missed her. They were all, the
whole six of them, Madeline included, gathered
in an eager group around the signal-fire,
which wouldn’t burn, in spite of John’s most
valiant efforts, because the wind was so strong.</p>

<p>“Oh, Babe, was there any alcohol left?”
asked Madeline, glancing up as Babe came toward
them. She was stooping in front of the
beacon-holder, with her skirt spread out to
shelter the struggling little flame. “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
think there could be any harm in pouring a
little on this wood, do you, Mrs. Hildreth?”
she went on. “There’s nothing up here to
take fire.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember noticing about the alcohol,”
answered Babe, making a valiant effort
not to catch her breath.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and look,” volunteered Betty.</p>

<p>“No, let me.” John sprang forward.</p>

<p>“You’d never find the flask,” objected Betty,
“or if you did you’d mix up everything in
the tea-basket.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go together,” said John, and
Babe breathed a sigh of relief. She couldn’t
have let Betty go back there alone without
warning her and she hated to admit that she
had been frightened by&mdash;what could it have
been anyway, since it wasn’t Madeline in Mrs.
Hildreth’s white shawl? Mrs. Hildreth had
on her shawl at that very moment.</p>

<p>Betty and John were gone some time, and
when they finally appeared Babe knew at once
that they had seen the lady in white.</p>

<p>“Oh, Babbie,” Betty began tremulously,
“there is a ghost attached to your castle&mdash;or
at least a something. It’s down in the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of the wood, near the lawn where we left the
basket. And it’s moaning in the most horrible
way.”</p>

<p>“Truly?” Babbie appealed to John.</p>

<p>“Sure. It’s not a ghost, of course, but it’s
somebody all right, in a long white cloak sort
of thing, with one hand stretched out, holding
something red. The way it cries is
certainly spooky,” added John, with a forced
laugh.</p>

<p>Madeline exchanged swift glances with Mr.
Dwight. “‘A trailing white robe and a sob
in the night’&mdash;that was what the old crone
said, wasn’t it? And there was nothing there
when you came up, Babe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw it,” said Babe with careful unconcern,
“but of course it can’t be a ghost&mdash;nobody
believes in ghosts nowadays. I
thought it was one of you girls trying to
frighten me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a white cow,” suggested Babbie.
“They make queer noises sometimes. Don’t
you remember that the fierce black one did?”</p>

<p>But this suggestion was received with great
contempt by all three of the ghost-seers, who
declared excitedly that they could tell the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
difference between a cow and a woman, even
if it was a little dusky in the wood.</p>

<p>“Well, of course I don’t want it to turn
out to be a cow,” Babbie explained apologetically.
“But it seems too good to be true
that it’s a ghost. I’m going down to find it
this very minute.”</p>

<p>“Alone?” inquired Babe gravely.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” interposed Mrs. Hildreth
promptly, when Madeline pointed down to
the open lawn below them.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to go down, Babbie. Look
there.”</p>

<p>The white figure was coming slowly, silently
out from behind a clump of tall bushes. The
moon had risen above the trees, and shone
full on the little lawn in front of the castle,
making it almost as bright as day. Slowly,
silently the white figure came forward, trailing
its robe over the short grass, one hand
held aloft, its gaze fastened on what the hand
held&mdash;a bright bit of cloth, it seemed to be.
When it had reached the centre of the lawn,
the figure paused and throwing back its head,
so that the moonlight fell full on its face&mdash;the
sweet, sad face of a young girl&mdash;it began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the uncanny moaning that had sent Babe
flying to find her friends.</p>

<p>“Gaelic,” whispered Madeline under her
breath. “I heard the words for love and
grief.”</p>

<p>“She’s changed to English now,” whispered
Mr. Dwight after a minute. “She’s crying,
‘My prince, my prince, my prince,’ over and
over.”</p>

<p>“What’s that in her hand?” asked Babe,
who was clinging tight to Betty.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit of Scotch plaid, isn’t it?” Babbie
answered. “That pretty red kind&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The royal Stuart,” supplied Madeline.</p>

<p>“Then it is Flora Macdonald.” In her excitement
Babbie forgot to speak low. “And
she’s kept a bit of the Stuart plaid in memory
of the prince whose life she saved. She was
in love with him, of course, and she got him
off to France, and he forgot her. And they
locked her up here right afterward, when she
was feeling the worst about having him gone.
Oh, it all fits in beautifully! How can you
help believing in ghosts after this?”</p>

<p>“How, indeed?” agreed Madeline drily.
“Oh, ghost!” She raised her voice. “Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
up on the turret of yon gray donjon, and help
us toast marshmallows in the blaze of the
beacon light.”</p>

<p>“Madeline!” chorused three indignant
voices, while John burst into peals of laughter
and Mrs. Hildreth, who had been let into
Madeline’s secret, reproached the girls for
having been so gullible.</p>

<p>“Though it was a very effective ghost,” she
admitted, “and Madeline’s awe-struck face, as
she repeated the old woman’s description, was
capital.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame it all on me,” protested Madeline.
“Mr. Dwight is a fellow conspirator.”</p>

<p>“But you thought of it,” Mr. Dwight reminded
her, “and you planned where we
should get a ghost, and you coached her for the
part. I only smuggled out the costume, consisting
of a pair of Miss MacNish’s best linen
sheets, and introduced Miss Ayres and the
ghost down at the farmhouse. Here she is,
by the way. Miss MacBrague, come and meet
your admiring audience and receive their congratulations.
You took everybody in.”</p>

<p>Then there were introductions, explanations,
and questions all at once. Madeline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
had to tell how she had thought of evoking a
spectre to complete Babbie’s castle, but knew
she should be discovered at once if she or any
one else in the picnic-party was missing when
the ghost appeared. Mr. Dwight had suggested
Miss MacBrague, who lived down the
road with her grandparents, and was interested
in the old folk-tales of the countryside.
Miss MacBrague apologized prettily for her
performance.</p>

<p>“I dinna go to the play,” she said. “I
havena seen the great actors as ye have. I
did only just as Miss Ayres showed me, and
the crying is like the crying that the old
people do at the graves. I am verra glad if
it pleased ye, and I hope ye were na really
frighted,” turning to Babe.</p>

<p>“You ought to go on the stage. You’re a
perfectly splendid actress,” Babe declared
fervently. “But it’s mean of you to oblige
me to confess how I ran away from you.”</p>

<p>And then there were more questions and
explanations, and the laugh was on Babe.</p>

<p>Between times they had toasted all the
marshmallows, though Babbie protested that
it was taking a mean advantage of her beacon-holder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
to turn it to such base uses; and at
last Mrs. Hildreth said it was time to start
back. They dropped little Miss MacBrague
at her home after having received her thanks
for “th’ gae good time ye’ve given me,” and
made her promise to come and see them in
Oban, and drove briskly home, for the sky
had clouded over, and the air was full of rain.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Babbie jubilantly.
“I can feel the curl walking out of my
feather, but who cares for a little thing like
that? Never as long as I live shall I forget
the lovely, thrilly, creepy feeling that came
over me when I saw my very own ghost
walking out of the beech-wood in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>“I say, that was rather fine, wasn’t it?”
said John. “You girls are certainly keeping
out of the rut of ordinary European travel.”</p>

<p>“That’s because we have dominant interests,”
explained Madeline. “Mine is tea-rooms,
Babbie’s is evidently ghosts, and
Babe’s is&mdash;let me see&mdash;chimney-pots.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to change,” Babe protested in
the general laugh that followed. “I chose in
too much of a hurry. I want an interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that you can follow up. You can’t follow up
chimney-pots. They’re all right there on the
surface.”</p>

<p>“On the roofs, you mean,” laughed John,
“and only chimney-sweeps can penetrate their
inner mysteries. What’s your specialty, Miss
Wales?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any yet,” explained Betty.
“I’m hoping mine will turn up before long,
though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find you something in London,”
Madeline promised her easily. “There is
something for everybody in London.”</p>

<span class="smaller">BETTY DISCOVERS HER SPECIALTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Staying</span> in lodgings in a villa by the sea
is awfully English, but so are a lot of other
things,” said Madeline briskly. “We’ve seen
about all there is to see in this neighborhood,
and I think we ought to be pushing on.”</p>

<p>It was nearly a week after the ghost party.
The girls had spent the two really pleasant
days in visiting Glencoe and Iona, both of
which were so lovely that Betty had insisted
upon calling on the crusty old stationer to
thank him for suggesting them. Now they
were gathered in the sitting-room, Baedekers
in hand, holding a conclave on where to go
next.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Babe. “It’s been so
jolly here! I wish we could settle down for
all summer. But of course I know it would
be silly to come way across the ocean and then
just stick in one spot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“John’s not going to stay all summer,
Babe,” said Babbie pointedly, for during the
week the friendship between the man-hater
and the woman-hater had progressed marvelously.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” Babe’s tone was as unconcerned
as if she had not solemnly promised to
furnish John with a dated itinerary of their
trip, and to write him the very minute they
changed their plans.</p>

<p>“Dwight thinks we ought to stay on here
till he’s finished coaching me,” John had told
her mournfully; “because there are so few
distractions to take a fellow’s mind from his
work. But it will be deadly dull after
you’ve gone.”</p>

<p>“Have you a lot more to do?” Babe had
asked.</p>

<p>“No. If I boned hard, I think I could
finish in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Then why in the world don’t you bone
hard?” demanded Babe bluntly. “Then you
can do as you please all the rest of the
summer, can’t you?”</p>

<p>John nodded. “After he gets me off his
hands, Dwight’s going to study at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
British Museum and then at some big library
in Paris. He’s getting material for his
doctor’s thesis. I’m going to keep with him
for a while and then join the governor somewhere
and go home with him in time to start
in at the same old grind next fall. I don’t
envy myself the trip across, either,” sighed
John.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Babe. “You
ought to like traveling with your father.”</p>

<p>John shrugged his shoulders. “He’ll be in
the very dickens of a temper by that time.
You see he’s been sent over here by his doctor
for a long vacation, and he’s raging around
Europe in his automobile, getting madder and
madder every minute, because he’s on strict
orders to do nothing but loaf, and he doesn’t
dare to disobey instructions.”</p>

<p>“He’ll like it when he gets started,” suggested
Babe, soothingly.</p>

<p>“Never,” laughed John. “You don’t know
my father. The very mention of a vacation
affects him just the way Miss Wales’s red cap
did that old Scotch cow. You ought to see
the letters he writes me. They get fiercer and
fiercer each time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Well, if he’s that kind it will please him
to know that you’re working hard. So I advise
you all the more to pitch in and hustle
through,” Babe had finished, forcibly if not
elegantly. “Give yourself two weeks&mdash;or
three, to be perfectly safe&mdash;and then dare
yourself to finish.”</p>

<p>“If I did that, I’d probably want to go sailing
all the time, or I’d dawdle over an exciting
novel and forget all about my limit.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much use for a person who dares
himself and then loses,” said Babe coolly.
“Are you that sort?”</p>

<p>John did not answer at all at the time, but
on the day the girls left Oban he took Babe to
one side. “Meet you anywhere you like three
weeks from day before yesterday,” he announced
gaily.</p>

<p>“Good for you!” returned Babe. “I’ll
keep you posted.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a pin to remind you of your promise,”
said John, holding out a stick-pin set
with a Scotch cairngorm. “Girls have such
short memories.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t any shorter memories than
boys,” declared Babe indignantly. “I’m just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
as much obliged for the pin, but I don’t
need it.”</p>

<p>“Take it as a souvenir of Oban, then,”
urged John.</p>

<p>Babe looked longingly at the sparkling yellow
stone. “Do you take back what you said
about girls’ memories?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I don’t know much about
the general run of girls,” John qualified.
“Babbie Hildreth remembers her promises all
right, and I’m sure you do.”</p>

<p>“You’re the one that’s likely not to be able
to keep this particular promise,” said Babe,
pinning the cairngorm into her blue tie, which
showed it off to perfection. “You mustn’t
come, you know, unless you’ve finished your
work. College boys are such dreadful idlers.”</p>

<p>“They’re not,” declared John hotly. “I’ll
show you that this one isn’t, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Babe. “And I’ll
show you that my memory isn’t short. Then
we shall be quits again.”</p>

<p>Babe wrote Bob all about the cairngorm pin,
but she didn’t mention it to her traveling
companions. Babbie would think she was
silly to talk about it. She knew such loads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
of men, and they were always giving her
flowers and pretty trinkets. So merely to
avoid discussion Babe said nothing at all about
the matter, letting the rest think that she had
bought the pin herself as a memento of her
dear Oban.</p>

<p>“Nothing else will be quite so nice!” she
sighed as the train pulled out of the little station,
and the others all felt a little the same
way,&mdash;except Madeline, of course, who always
loved beginnings.</p>

<p>“Why do we stay at Glasgow to-night?”
she said. “We’ve done that already. Let’s
take Mrs. Hildreth to a farewell tea at Miss
Jelliff’s, and then go on to Balloch. There’s
an inn there with the loveliest name&mdash;Tullichewan
Inn. Doesn’t that sound quaint and
out-of-the-way? Then we shall be one station
further on toward the Trossachs, and we shan’t
have to get up so early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“That argument appeals to me,” laughed
Mrs. Hildreth, and it was settled to go on to
Balloch.</p>

<p>“What are the Trossachs, anyway?” inquired
Betty plaintively. “People have talked
to me about the Trossachs ever since I knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
I was coming to Scotland, but when I’ve
asked just what they were, I never could find
out.”</p>

<p>“This guide-book says that the word means
‘bristling country,’” Babbie explained. “All
the hills that you coach over are thickly
wooded. There are lakes, too, but I guess
they haven’t anything to do with the name.”</p>

<p>Next day Babe amended the definition to
“dripping country.” Scotch mists alternated
with unmistakable showers all day, the hills
were hidden behind thick mantles of gray
fog, and the picturesque little lakes looked
forlorn enough, with the big rain-drops pattering
down on their placid waters.</p>

<p>“Catechism for travelers,” announced Babe.
“Query one: How do you go through the
Trossachs? Answer: In a rain. I know
what you’re going to say, Betty, but I’ve talked
to all the people on board who’ve been through
before or who’ve had friends who’ve been
through, and that’s the correct answer.
Query two: What is a Trossach coach?
Answer: A place where everybody’s umbrella
drips on everybody else and pokes your hat
off, and you wish you were snug at home by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the fire. Besides, they aren’t coaches at all;
they’re nothing but four-seated mountain-wagons.
And I thought coaching was going
to be one of the most glorious joys of the
summer!” Babe sighed and carefully emptied
the water out of the wrinkles in her ulster.</p>

<p>But the coaching trip through the English
lakes satisfied Babe’s most extravagant anticipations.
It came after a commonplace, very
rainy week in Edinburgh, where everybody
was too busy getting over colds caught in the
Trossachs rain-storm to make any progress
with “dominant interests.” It was a lovely,
sparkling morning, and the coach which was
to take them from Keswick to Windermere
was a real coach, with seats inside for any one
who was foolish enough to want them, seats
on top which commanded a splendid view of
the pretty English country, and a red-coated,
red-faced English coachman who dropped his
h’s and cracked his long whip in exactly the
approved story-book fashion. But the most
exciting part of the day came when they
stopped for lunch at the little village of Grasmere.</p>

<p>“Three whole hours!” cried Babbie joyously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
“Mother doesn’t feel like exploring,
so she’s going to wait for us at the inn. Have
lunch whenever you’re ready, mummie. If
Wordsworth’s Dove Cottage and the old church
where he’s buried are too fascinating we may
decide to save time by lunching aboard the
coach on fruit and sweet chocolate.”</p>

<p>“I’m terribly afraid Dove Cottage will be
like Burns’ birthplace,” said Madeline, as
they started off. “Another maxim for travelers:
Be cautious about poets’ homes. Anyhow
Wordsworth never stayed in the house
when he could help it on a day like this&mdash;I’m
sure he didn’t. Let’s walk up that fascinating
shady road first. It looks as if it led
to something interesting.”</p>

<p>“Now Madeline,” protested Betty, “how
does a road that leads to something interesting
look different from one that doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“How indeed, man from Cook’s?” Babbie
joined her, and the dispute waxed so warm
that finally Madeline asked a little girl, who
was eyeing them shyly over a garden fence,
where this particular road went.</p>

<p>“Proves my point,” she announced triumphantly.
“It goes to Easdale Tarn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“What’s a tarn?” asked Babe. “A lake?
Then it doesn’t prove anything at all. Some
lakes are interesting and some aren’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t quarrel, children,” interposed Betty.
“When we get to the tarn we can see whether
it’s interesting.”</p>

<p>“But who knows how far it is?” objected
Babbie. “Have we time to walk to
it?”</p>

<p>The small girl had run off to play by this
time, but a little old lady was pottering about
among the flowers in another garden, and she
told the girls that the tarn was only a mile
away and showed them a cross-cut through
the meadows.</p>

<p>Beyond that the road turned into a path and
climbed up hills, and then down again, but
mostly up, so that following it was hot and
tiresome work.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m not hungry,” sighed Babe.
“Do you see that comfortable white farmhouse?
When we go back let’s stop there and
have lunch. They’d surely give us bread and
milk out of pity for our famished state.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Madeline, “but we’ve
got to hurry right along now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Just then the path curved sharply, and
around the turn they came suddenly upon an
elderly gentleman who was sitting on a big
stone, fanning himself with his Panama hat.</p>

<p>“My word!” he exclaimed, when he saw
the girls. “What in creation are you young
ladies doing away off here?”</p>

<p>Babbie was ahead. “Going to Easdale
Tarn,” she explained demurely. “This is
the right road, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, I don’t know,” said the elderly
gentleman. “Never heard of Easdale Tarn
till you mentioned it. My doctor told me to
take a walk every day, and I chose this road
because I happened to see it.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather hilly, isn’t it?” said Babe, who
was quite out of breath.</p>

<p>The gentleman jumped up and waved a
hand at his stone seat. “Sit down and get
rested,” he commanded so peremptorily that
Babe obeyed without a word.</p>

<p>“You too.” He pointed at Betty, who sank
down beside Babe.</p>

<p>“I admire your energy,” the old gentleman
went on briskly. “I always admire energy.
But in this case it also excites my curiosity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Why are you all so anxious to go to Easdale
Tarn?”</p>

<p>“To find out if it’s interesting,” explained
Babe, and told the whole story of the dispute
about the road.</p>

<p>The old gentleman laughed heartily, and
then he sighed. “Wish I could get as excited
as that about this milk-and-water scenery.
Well, run along and find your tarn,&mdash;all but
you,” indicating Betty. “You’re too tired to
go any further. You’d better stay right here
with me until the others get back.”</p>

<p>“I am tired,” admitted Betty, blushing
furiously, “but I think I’d better go on. You
said you were taking a walk, and I don’t want
to keep you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I said my doctor told me to take walks,”
interposed the old gentleman irascibly. “At
present I am sitting here enjoying the view,
or, to speak quite truthfully, staring at the
view without seeing it, and wishing I were
back in New York.”</p>

<p>“But Betty wants to see the tarn too,”
urged Babe, who resented such autocratic
methods. “Come on, Betty. You can rest
all the afternoon in the coach.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Betty half rose, hesitated, and then something
in the rather wistful smile that the old
gentleman gave her from under his bushy
eyebrows made her decide to stay.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I am too tired to enjoy seeing
anything more, even if it’s interesting,” she
told the girls. “So if you’re sure you won’t
mind waiting, sir&mdash;it’s rather lonely here to
stay alone.”</p>

<p>“I assure you it will be only a pleasure to
wait with you,” declared the old gentleman
with fine, old-fashioned courtesy. “Solitary
walks are a dull sort of amusement.”</p>

<p>So while the rest went in pursuit of the
tarn Betty talked to the old gentleman. He
was traveling alone, it seemed, for his health,
and he hated traveling, hated doctors, and
despised himself for having let one of them
bundle him off willy-nilly, like a molly-coddle
old woman who had nothing in the
world to do but count her pulse and worry
about her digestion.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think you’d get well faster
if you just made up your mind to it and tried
to enjoy things and have a good time?”
asked Betty timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” retorted the old
gentleman savagely. “‘Make up your mind
to it. Why, you ought to consider yourself a
lucky dog to be able to go off like this, chasing
health around the world, if necessary.
How we envy you!’ Envy! Well, they
needn’t.” He smiled his wistful smile again.
“Fact is, when I was young, I hadn’t any
chance to play&mdash;I was too busy hustling to
pay for bread and butter and an attic room.
Now I’m too old to learn. But I like to see
young people play well, if they work well too.
I’ve got a boy&mdash;the young rascal&mdash;oh, well,
you don’t want to hear me scold about my
boy. Tell me where you’ve been and where
you’re going and why it is that you like your
Europe so well.”</p>

<p>So he led Betty on to tell him about the going-away
party at Mary’s, about the senator
and the emigrants and the ghost of Dunstaffnage;
and they had gotten back to the United
States and Harding College again, before the
others appeared.</p>

<p>“My dear, I appreciate your staying to talk
with me,” he said finally. “I had a daughter
once, but she died. I should like her to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
grown up to be like you,&mdash;or like that little
tomboy that stood up to me and insisted you
should go on if you pleased. I couldn’t get
her for a private secretary next fall, could I?
She wouldn’t cry if I happened to find fault
with the way she took my dictation.”</p>

<p>Just then Babe herself appeared, leading
the others.</p>

<p>“We didn’t find it,” she sang out cheerfully.
“That old lady’s idea of a mile is exaggerated.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t dare go any further for fear of
missing the coach and worrying mummie,”
added Babbie.</p>

<p>“In a hurry to get back to the village,
are you?” asked the old gentleman. “I’ve
got a car waiting for me somewhere down
there at the foot of the hill. You can all
squeeze in for that little distance, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” said Babe, “but we were
going to have lunch first&mdash;bread and milk at
the farmhouse near the foot of the hill, if
they’ll give it to us. We’ve allowed time
for that, and we’re just perishing of hunger.
Thank you just as much about the ride.”</p>

<p>“Bread and milk at a farmhouse,” repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the old gentleman briskly. “I&mdash;I believe
I’m hungry too. Would it be intrusive&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, please do come,” said Betty eagerly.
“I’ve made you miss your lunch at the inn,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>So the old gentleman scrambled down the
hill with Betty and Babe, while Madeline
and Babbie ran ahead to make sure of the
luncheon and get the preparations for it under
way. The bread and butter was so good and
the milk so creamy, and they all ate and
drank so much, while the old gentleman
forgot to be annoyed at his unhappy plight
and told funny stories of his motoring experiences
in France,&mdash;neither he nor his
chauffeur, it seemed, knew a word of any
language but English,&mdash;that the time slipped
by, and when Babe thought to look at her
watch it was long past the hour that she had
allotted to lunching.</p>

<p>“There’s Dove Cottage gone!” she announced
in tragic tones. “And when we
get back to America and people ask us about
it, how we shall hate to say we were right
here and didn’t take enough interest in Wordsworth
to hunt up his house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” Madeline reassured her
cheerfully. “We’ll just inquire in a casual
way if they saw Easdale Tarn, when they
were here, and that will settle them.”</p>

<p>“The only trouble is we didn’t see it either,”
matter-of-fact Betty reminded her sadly.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was looking at his
watch and muttering hasty calculations.
“You shall see your Dove Cottage,” he announced
triumphantly. “You didn’t count
on going back in my car. Come along.”</p>

<p>The next minute they were tearing down
the Easdale road at a rate that the old gentleman
smilingly characterized as “about our
usual speed, and we’ve only been arrested
once so far.” When they reached the cottage
he sat outside in the car, watch in hand,
ready to give the signal for departure, and
at the church he did the same thing. Then
they whirled back to the inn, where Mrs.
Hildreth was getting a little anxious about
them, though, as Babbie pointed out, five
minutes before the coach started was a whole
lot of time&mdash;you could see all the regular
sights of Grasmere in five minutes if you were
a good manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Betty and Babe, who had taken a great
fancy to the crusty old gentleman, stayed
behind the others to say a more extended
good-bye.</p>

<p>“We’re really very grateful to you,” Babe
assured him gaily. “You’ve saved our reputations.
But for you the Grasmere chapter
of  ‘B. A.’s Abroad’ would have had a disgraceful
blank in it.”</p>

<p>“‘B. A.’s Abroad,’”&mdash;the old gentleman
turned to Betty. “That’s the journal you
told me about. B. A.&mdash;Benevolent Adventurers&mdash;that’s
what you’ve been this morning.
I haven’t had so good a time since I left New
York. Thank you all, and you particularly,
Miss&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wales,” supplied Betty.</p>

<p>“Miss Wales, I hope we shall meet again
during the summer. I’m going back to
France, where they have respectable roads.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to look out for Betty, mummie,”
laughed Babbie, when they were settled
again on the coach. “All the high-and-mighty
personages just naturally gravitate
to her. First there was the senator, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
now this grand magnate. Who was he,
Betty?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t tell me his name, and I didn’t
like to ask.”</p>

<p>“He’s certainly a person of importance,”
declared Madeline. “He talks about New
York as if he pretty nearly owned it, and
did you notice how frantically the inn servants
flew around when he appeared?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t fly around when he appeared,”
said Babe proudly, and was much amused
and elated when Betty repeated what he had
said about her.</p>

<p>“I think benevolent adventures are going
to turn out to be Betty’s dominant interest,”
said Babe, after relating the old gentleman’s
interpretation of B. A. “First there were the
emigrants and now this old gentleman. I
wonder whom you’ll find next to cheer up.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “I think that’s a funny
kind of a dominant interest for traveling.
Why, you can be nice to people just as well
when you’re at home.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re elected to try it a while
longer,” declared Babbie, “and see how it
works. It’s certainly been amusing so far.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
The very point about a good dominant interest,
you know, is that it’s queer. Anybody
can take Gothic architecture or Mary Queen
of Scots, but ghosts, tea-rooms, chimney-pots,
and benevolent adventures show real originality.
Girls, aren’t we having a good time?”</p>

<span class="smaller">BUYING A DUKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the lakes the B. A.’s traveled slowly
and merrily to London, where they established
themselves at a quiet boarding-house
overlooking a pretty square, and plunged into
a mad delirium of sight-seeing and shopping.</p>

<p>“I never felt pulled in so many directions
in my life,” complained Babe wearily. “The
shop-windows are so fascinating, and things
are all so cheap, and it’s such fun paying for
them in this comical English money.”</p>

<p>“And your friends will all be so glad to
get whatever you don’t want for yourself because
it came from abroad,” put in Babbie.
“I’m going to do all my Christmas shopping
here and in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I want to, too,” agreed Babe, “but
all the time I’m in the shops I keep thinking
how the places I’ve wanted to see for ages
and perhaps never can see again are all within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
a stone’s throw&mdash;well, within a ’bus-ride, if
you like that better, and I decide to go sight-seeing
with Madeline. But when you and
Mrs. Hildreth and Betty come home at night
with all your fascinating packages from Liberty’s
and the Irish lace stores, why then I
wish I’d shopped.”</p>

<p>“You can’t have everything,” said Madeline
sagely. “That’s been my motto for
years, and it’s never so useful as when I’m
traveling. You don’t enjoy anything unless
you make up your mind not to worry about
the things you’ve got to miss. I’m going
shopping myself to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I thought you hated it,” exclaimed all her
auditors at once.</p>

<p>“But this isn’t any ordinary shopping tour.
I’m going to buy Eleanor’s duke&mdash;that is, if
the rest of you will trust me to pick him out.”</p>

<p>“Of course we will,” said Babbie, “but why
can’t we all come, too, and help?”</p>

<p>“Babbie, you promised me you would stay
quietly at home to-morrow and rest,” Mrs.
Hildreth reminded her.</p>

<p>“Well, so I will,” Babbie gave up cheerfully.
“And Babe has a luncheon engagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
with the friend from home that she
met in the American express office.”</p>

<p>“Then Betty and I will go duke-hunting,”
said Madeline. “That suits me perfectly.
Too many matchmakers would be fatal. The
duke would detect our eagerness and demand
an exorbitant settlement. Dukes come high,
you know, at best, so be prepared to be generous
with your shillings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Madeline, do tell us what you’re going
to get,” begged Babbie. But Madeline
only smiled mysteriously and told Mrs. Hildreth
that she and Betty probably shouldn’t
be back for luncheon.</p>

<p>Next morning when they were safely out of
ear-shot she divulged her idea. “You know
those pretty old Staffordshire china figures?
The spotted dogs are the commonest, but there
are men and women, too. Oh, you must have
seen them, Betty, in the windows of the antique
shops&mdash;shepherdesses with looped-up
skirts, leaning on their crooks, and cute little
men with lace ruffles at their wrists and pink
coats and silver knee-buckles. They look
awfully aristocratic; somehow, I don’t think
we could get a better duke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Betty hadn’t noticed anything of the sort,
so they went a block out of their way down
Oxford Street to see some in a shop that
Madeline remembered. Sure enough, the window
was full of the queer little china figures,
and there was one that Betty declared was
just the duke for Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Let’s go right in and get it,” she urged
jubilantly. “It’s so quaint and&mdash;oh, so
European somehow. Eleanor will be perfectly
delighted.”</p>

<p>Madeline laughed at her innocent enthusiasm.
“We can’t afford to buy it here,”
she warned her. “Those figures are dreadfully
expensive. In a fashionable neighborhood
like this they’d probably ask eight or
ten dollars for that duke. But the other day
when Babe and I were riding on a ’bus away
out toward Hammersmith to see how far you
could go for fourpence, I noticed a whole
cluster of antique shops, and I thought we
might find a real bargain out there.”</p>

<p>“But this is such a pretty, graceful little
figure,” said Betty doubtfully. “How much
are we going to spend for each of the girls?”</p>

<p>“The gargoyles and the photograph that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Helen wanted won’t be over sixty cents, so
I suppose we ought to find something at about
that price for the general present to Eleanor
and Bob. Then, of course, we can any of us
take any of them whatever extra things we like.”</p>

<p>“Let’s just ask about this duke,” urged
Betty, who had lost her heart to the little
china figure, and couldn’t believe it cost as
much as Madeline thought.</p>

<p>But “Thirty-five shillings,” said the pompous
shop-keeper, and Betty had to explain
blushingly that she couldn’t afford so much
that morning.</p>

<p>“That’s eight dollars and seventy-five
cents,” she said dejectedly, as they went off
to find the Hammersmith ’bus. “We can’t
ever get one for sixty cents, Madeline. The
neighborhood wouldn’t make eight dollars
difference.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madeline easily.
“I’ve bought silver boxes in Holland for
thirty cents and matched them on Fifth
Avenue for five dollars. Anyhow it will be
fun hunting.”</p>

<p>It was fun. The Hammersmith shops were
crowded with all sorts of interesting old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
odds-and-ends, the like of which Betty had
never seen before. She admired the glib way
in which Madeline chatted with the shop-keepers
about strange things like black Wedgwood,
Chippendale chairs, and Flemish inlay.
But when they inquired for Staffordshire
figures no one seemed to have any, or at least
not any that could pass for a duke. But
every one was very obliging about suggesting
more shops to try, and when that particular
neighborhood was quite exhausted some one
sent the girls off on what proved to be a wild
goose chase to the shops near Nottinghill
Gate, “where there isn’t any hill nor any
gate,” as Betty explained later, in relating
the day’s adventures, “so how can you tell
when to get off the ’bus?”</p>

<p>And as they couldn’t tell, they were
carried six blocks past and had to walk back
in the noonday heat, only to find that the
biggest shop, which had been so highly
recommended, kept nothing but brasses.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in here,” said Madeline, opening
the door of a dusky little second-hand store
with an impatient jerk, “and if they haven’t
what we want we’ll stop. Yes, no matter if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
they tell us positively that a shop round the
corner is packed tight with Staffordshire
figures, we won’t go to it. Instead we’ll go
and get a cool and luscious luncheon,&mdash;though
where we can find one in this dingy
neighborhood, I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>A small girl with wisps of tow-colored hair
falling over her eyes came out from a back
room to see what they wanted.</p>

<p>She shook her head doubtfully when Madeline
mentioned Staffordshire. “I’m sure I
couldn’t say, ma’am. She’s out&mdash;the madame
is&mdash;and I couldn’t rightly say what we have.
Would you know it if you saw it? You
might look about then.”</p>

<p>So they “looked about,” among the curious
agglomeration of mirrors, candlesticks, lustre
jugs, cameos, and time-stained engravings, all
standing in dusty disarray on top of Queen
Anne sideboards, carved centre tables, and
beautiful old Sheraton writing-desks with secret
compartments, that set Betty, who was having
her first taste of the delights of antique-hunting,
wild with delight. But though they
poked into every nook and corner, no
Staffordshire figures came to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we shall have to give it up,” said
Madeline dejectedly. “How much is that
lustre pitcher, please&mdash;the fat little one with
the roses in the border?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, ma’am,” confessed the little
maid sadly. “You see very few comes here
in the morning, and it’s so very difficult remembering
the prices, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Madeline wanted the fat little
pitcher all the more now that she couldn’t
have it. “When will the owner of the shop
be back, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I really couldn’t say, ma’am. In an
hour perhaps, and maybe not till time for tea.
You see it’s Friday, and she’s gone to market.
But she went early to-day, so she might be
back early.”</p>

<p>“But does it ever take her all day to do the
family marketing?” asked Madeline curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not for the family, ma’am; it’s for
the shop she’s buying. Everybody goes to the
market on Fridays.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean by everybody?”</p>

<p>“Why, all the dealers in London, ma’am.
The madame buys almost everything there.
Things go very cheap there, you see. It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
pity she didn’t know what you were wanting,
or she’d have found it for you this morning.
You can find almost anything at the market
if you look sharp.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you couldn’t tell us how to get
there?” inquired Madeline tentatively.</p>

<p>Oh, yes she could; any one in London could
do that. It was the Caledonian market, you
understand. First you took the Underground
to King’s Cross, and then you took the ’bus to
Market Road, and any one would tell you
where to get down. And after that it was
just a step to the market.</p>

<p>“What a find!” Madeline caught Betty’s
arm as soon as they were outside, and fairly
danced her down the street. “We shall get
all sorts of bargains in dukes there, and then
it’s such a lovely stunt hunting them along
with all the dealers in London. We’ll buy
some fruit and eat it on the Underground.
Where is the Underground, I wonder? She
said everybody went there Friday mornings.
Should you think it would close at twelve or
at one?”</p>

<p>Of course Betty hadn’t the least idea. In
fact she couldn’t quite see what there was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
be so excited about, but as usual she took
Madeline’s word for it.</p>

<p>“Markets are great,” Madeline explained
when they had at last found the Underground.
“I’ve been to the rag-fair in Rome and the
Christmas-sale in Paris, and they were both
no end of fun. Some one told father about
a big market in London, but he never could
find it. Won’t he be envious when I bring
out my trophies!”</p>

<p>When they got into the ’bus for Market
Road nearly every other passenger was laden
with a big basket.</p>

<p>“They’re going to market, too,” Madeline
nudged Betty. “So we’re not hopelessly late
after all.”</p>

<p>When they had turned in at the big gates
Betty stared about her in amazement. The
vast open space was thronged with a laughing,
chattering crowd of buyers. But above the
noise they made rose the strident cries of the
marketmen.</p>

<p>“Penny a mar-r-r-ket bunch!”</p>

<p>“Whatever-you-like at yer own price.”</p>

<p>“Rusty nails! Rusty na-ils!”</p>

<p>It took time to disentangle even those few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
cries from the multitude of strange announcements.</p>

<p>“Who would want rusty nails?” demanded
Betty.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but there they are&mdash;pounds
and pounds of them. Somebody must want
them or they wouldn’t be here. Isn’t it fun having
everything spread out on the ground?”</p>

<p>“Literally everything,” laughed Betty.
“Books and china and second-hand calico
wrappers, and&mdash;yes, Madeline, second-hand
tooth-brushes, right next to that lovely inlaid
furniture.”</p>

<p>“And there’s a Persian kitten,” added
Madeline. “Poor little pussy! She looks
frightened half to death.”</p>

<p>“And hats and furs,” put in Betty.</p>

<p>“And jewelry. Betty, I’ll buy you a penny
pin as a memento. Choose.”</p>

<p>Betty chose a brooch consisting of a very
realistic red raspberry and two green leaves.
“Thank you,” she said, “and isn’t that a
lustre-ware pitcher?”</p>

<p>It was, and it was in the collection of a man
who was crying, “Whatever-ye-like at yer own
price,” at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“A shilling,” Madeline offered boldly,
pointing to the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Three,” retorted the man decisively.</p>

<p>“But you just said, ‘Whatever you like
at your own price,’” Madeline reminded
him.</p>

<p>The man winked cheerfully. “Any of this
rubbish, ma’am, I mean.” He picked up a
handful of the rusty nails. “You want only
the good things. The pitcher’s a bargain at
three bob.”</p>

<p>“Have you any Staffordshire figures?”
asked Madeline.</p>

<p>The man rummaged in a basket and produced
two little white lambs, each standing
on a hillock of green grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, how cunning,” murmured Betty. “I
simply must have those.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t act too anxious, or he’ll put
the price away up,” Madeline whispered.</p>

<p>“You buy them,” Betty whispered back.</p>

<p>“We wanted a man’s figure,” explained
Madeline nonchalantly. “You haven’t any?
Then I guess that’s all. How much are the
lambs?”</p>

<p>“Thrippence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take them,” cried Betty before Madeline
could answer.</p>

<p>The man looked amusedly from one to the
other. “You mustn’t quarrel over the baa-lambs,
ladies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t.” Betty held out her money.
“Madeline, look!”</p>

<p>A wizened, grizzled little Jew, whose wares
were spread out next to those of the owner of
the “baa-lambs,” had overheard their conversation
with his rival and was holding out a
figure, the exact counterpart of the one in the
Oxford Street shop. Madeline pinched Betty
to remind her not to appear over-anxious.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said indifferently, holding
out her hand for the little figure and examining
it carefully for cracks or nicks. “But
now that we’ve bought the lambs I don’t
know&mdash;how much is this?”</p>

<p>“Five bob, and you can’t find another such
bargain in London,” the dealer assured her
eagerly.</p>

<p>“What’s a bob?” whispered Betty.</p>

<p>“A shilling,” Madeline explained. Then
she turned to the dealer. “Make it two and
six.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_178.jpg" width="400" alt="“FOUR AND SIX!”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“FOUR AND SIX!”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“Four and six,” he compromised.</p>

<p>Madeline shook her head severely. “If
you’d said three and six I might have considered
it. Come on, Betty.”</p>

<p>Betty stared in amazement. Was Madeline&mdash;yes,
she was actually walking off. She
was going to leave that lovely duke. But just
as Madeline turned the corner, the little dealer
jumped up, the figure in one hand and a scrap
of crumpled paper in the other, and with a
bound he was at Madeline’s elbow.</p>

<p>“Have it for three and six,” he whispered
confidentially.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well.” Madeline accepted the
bundle nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Madeline. What have you done
him out of now?” Dick Blake was standing
in front of them, his face wreathed in smiles.
“I thought you’d be here to-day,” he went
on. “I had a ‘leading,’ as we used to say in
Paris when we wanted to do a silly thing, that
if I came up here I should lose all the Americans
but you. How do you like marketing
with Madeline, Miss Wales?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick, it’s jolly fun seeing you. But
what on earth are you doing here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Pursuing you,” explained Dick cheerfully.
“Didn’t I just say so? When I’m not pursuing
you, I’m pursuing a magnate. He’s
more elusive,&mdash;or at least I don’t know his
habits so well, and up to date I haven’t found
him. But I take my success with you to be
a good omen. I’m sure I shall spot my magnate
before long.”</p>

<p>“Please talk sense, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I am,” he assured her solemnly. “You
see it’s this way. New York was hot and
stupid, with everybody gone who could manage
to get away, and I wanted to go, too. But
‘The Quiver’ hasn’t been exactly booming
lately, and I couldn’t afford a nice trip.”</p>

<p>“Meaning a trip to Europe,” interposed
Madeline.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Dick took her up. “So I was
feeling awfully blue, and then a week ago to-night
my old chief down in Newspaper Row
’phoned and said, ‘Dickie, you’re the best
hunter we ever had. Go to Europe and find
an elusive magnate, whose mysterious absence
is upsetting Wall Street prices,’ and I said,
‘Done,’ and made up ‘The Quiver’ for two
months ahead, and here I am. I got to Liverpool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
last night and to London this morning,
and so far I’ve ascertained that the Elusive
Magnate aforesaid isn’t staying at any of the
likely hotels.”</p>

<p>“Dick, you are too absurd,” laughed Madeline.
“What’s your magnate’s name?”</p>

<p>“Morton&mdash;Jasper Jones Morton. Haven’t
seen him, have you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the pleasure of his acquaintance.
Have you, Betty?”</p>

<p>Betty shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got his picture here somewhere.”
Dick felt in his pocket and drew out a cabinet
photograph. “He’s not exactly handsome
and he’s never gone in for society, but
he’s really very well-to-do, and when he suddenly
departs for the first vacation of his long
and useful life, just when his railroads are in
a good deal of a muddle and several of his
corporations are being sued by Uncle Sam,
why, naturally Wall Street sits up and takes
notice.” He passed the picture to Madeline.</p>

<p>“Why, Betty, it’s our magnate,” she cried
laughingly, and Betty, looking at the picture
over her shoulder, gave a little shriek of delight.
“It is,” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Dick looked in amazement from one to the
other. “I say, have you really met him?”
he demanded. “Where was he, and which
way was he headed? He didn’t drop any hints
about his reasons for being over here, did he?”</p>

<p>Madeline looked at Betty. “You talked to
him most.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean did he say whether he is
over here just on a vacation for his health?”
asked Betty.</p>

<p>Dick nodded, and she repeated Mr. Jasper
Jones Morton’s anathemas against vacations,
doctors, and European travel. “I’m sure he
was telling the truth,” she added earnestly.
“He said it all as if he meant it,&mdash;he couldn’t
have been making up.”</p>

<p>“Having conversed with him about other
things he doesn’t like, I catch your point,”
chuckled Dick. “J. J. Morton’s earnest hatred
is very earnest indeed.” Then he grew sober
suddenly. “I wonder where’s the nearest
place to cable from. I must get this off at
once. Miss Wales, you’ve done me the best
kind of a good turn. You don’t mind my
taking your story, do you, since you haven’t
any possible use for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Morton won’t mind, will he?” asked
Betty anxiously. “He was awfully nice to us,
and it would be mean to take advantage of him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick, “I honestly don’t think
he’ll mind. I don’t believe he wants the
market to go to smash on his account. And
to me it means&mdash;well, I haven’t been here a
day yet; and the chief gave me a week to find
him and get an interview. So it means the
biggest kind of a big beat, Miss Wales, and
that means a juicy fee and a juicy fee
means&mdash;&mdash;” Dick stopped suddenly, bit his
lip, and then laughed. “I didn’t use to be so
mercenary, did I, Madeline? Then I have
your consent, Miss Wales? Are you girls
coming back with me?”</p>

<p>For the first part of the long ride Dick
Blake was silent, his face puckered into deep
wrinkles of thought. All at once he threw
back his head and laughed merrily. “I’ve
got it,” he said, “head-lines and all. Now we
can talk. What did you do the little Jew out
of, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we were buying a duke for Eleanor
Watson,” explained Madeline tantalizingly.
“She wants one, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The worried look came back to Dick’s fine
gray eyes. “Go slow, Madeline. You were
buying&mdash;&mdash; Eleanor wants a duke?”</p>

<p>Madeline took pity on him and unwrapped
the dainty figurine, which Dick duly admired.</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Wales,” he began suddenly,
“you don’t know where Jasper J. went
from Grasmere, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Betty repeated what the old gentleman had
said about the superiority of French roads.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’d better cross the channel
to-night,” sighed Dick, “and here’s where
I leave this ’bus. Wish I could go home
with you and see the rest of the ‘Merry
Hearts’ and have a good talk. Good-bye, Miss
Wales. So long, Madeline. See you again
somewhere over here.” And he was gone.</p>

<p>“Well,” Madeline told the others, when
they reached home, “we’ve got the duke and
he’s a darling, and we’ve found out the name
of the Grasmere magnate, and Betty’s been
being a B. A. again&mdash;to whom in the world do
you guess, but Dick Blake. It will be in all
the New York papers to-morrow morning.
How’s that for a strenuous day of it?”</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To-day’s</span> the third, isn’t it?” observed
Babe carelessly the next morning at breakfast.
“I believe I’ll stay at home and write
some letters.”</p>

<p>Babbie, who was sitting by the window,
happened to glance out at the street just then.
“You needn’t,” she announced calmly. “He’s
arriving this very minute in a hansom.”</p>

<p>“Who is arriving, Babbie?” asked Mrs.
Hildreth. Whereupon Babbie assured her
that she was utterly disqualified as a competent
chaperon; she ought to have grasped
the connection between John Morton and
Babe’s mad desire to write letters without any
help at all.</p>

<p>John was in high spirits. “Hope you’ve
noticed that I’m exactly on time,” he told
Babe in a confidential aside. “Old Dwight
nearly passed away with surprise when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
saw me settling down to a good steady grind.
It’s queer how people always think that if a
fellow doesn’t work it’s because he hasn’t
brains enough. Old Dwight said he actually
envied me my clear and logical mind. I told
him to tell that to dad, and he did&mdash;wrote a
corking letter all about me and my industry
and my marvelous progress. I can’t wait to
get dad’s answer.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be sure to be awfully pleased,” said
Babe sympathetically. “I’m pleased too.
If you hadn’t finished in time I should have
given you back your pin. I wouldn’t take
a pin from a shirk.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to escort us out to see the
sights of London, John?” asked Babbie.</p>

<p>“Of course. That’s why I came around so
early, before you’d had a chance to get started
off without me on a picnic or a ghost-hunt or
any other interesting festivity. What shall
we do first?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s have a ghost-hunt!” cried
Babbie eagerly. “We haven’t paid the least
speck of attention to ghosts since we left
Oban. I can’t have my dominant interest
so neglected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed John. “Only it isn’t
moonlight, and we should probably be ‘taken
in charge,’ as the police say over here, if we
made a sheeted ghost walk in London.”</p>

<p>“Then how are we going to have a ghost-party?”
asked Betty. “Madeline, think up
a way.”</p>

<p>Madeline considered. “First, we’ve got
to choose our ghosts&mdash;there are such quantities
in London. Then we must seek out their
haunts and conjure them to appear. If they
won’t, we shall have to go back some evening,
and try again by moonlight. Let’s each write
the name of our favorite London ghost on a
slip of paper. Babbie can draw one, because
ghosts are her dominant interest, and then
we’ll all start out in pursuit.”</p>

<p>This arrangement suited everybody, and
Madeline hunted up pencils and paper. She
wrote the name of her favorite ghost without
an instant’s consideration, but the others
had to think hard, and Babe was caught
slyly consulting a London Baedeker. John
chewed his pencil in solemn silence until
the rest were through. Then all at once
he banged the table triumphantly with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
fist, scribbled a name on his slip, and handed
it to Madeline, who was acting as mistress of
ceremonies.</p>

<p>“You’d better choose my ghost, Babbie,”
he announced. “If you do, I invite you
all to have luncheon with me at an appropriate
place.”</p>

<p>“It’s not fair offering bribes,” cried Babe.
“My ghost did that, and it got him into a
horrible scrape.”</p>

<p>“My ghost is a lady,” said Betty. “I think she
deserves some consideration on that account.”</p>

<p>“The special advantage of mine,” put in
Madeline, “is that his haunts are miles away
from here. Think of the lovely long ’bus ride
we could have.”</p>

<p>“Mine is both a lady and a royal personage,”
said Babbie impressively, “so she really
ought to come in ahead of any of yours. But
I’m going to be perfectly fair; I’ll draw out
a slip with my eyes shut. Dr. Samuel Johnson
wins,” she announced a minute later.</p>

<p>“And he’s mine!” cried John. “Now remember,
everybody, the meal-tickets are to be
on me. Did you girls ever hear of the
‘Cheshire Cheese’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>No one had but Madeline.</p>

<p>“What ignorance!” laughed John, and
then confessed that he never had heard of it
either, until Mr. Dwight mentioned it the
night before. “It seems it was quite a haunt
of old Dr. Johnson’s,” he explained. “It’s
a queer little eating-house just off Fleet Street.
You girls may not like it, but if you don’t
we needn’t stay.”</p>

<p>Babbie’s ghost was Queen Victoria, Betty’s
Becky Sharp, Madeline’s Carlyle, and Babe’s
Lord Bacon.</p>

<p>“What a collection!” laughed Madeline.
“Perhaps we can take in some of the others
on our way to the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Hand
me the Baedeker please, Babe.”</p>

<p>But John objected. “We’ve got to make
perfectly sure of Dr. Johnson first,” he said
firmly. “What’s the use of choosing a ghost
if you don’t keep to him? Besides, remember,
I got down here only late last evening.
If we have any extra time, I want to go and
register my address at the American Express
office and get my mail. I’m expecting an
important letter.” John looked at Babe impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>After much lively discussion it was voted
to walk to the “Cheshire Cheese,” or at least
to walk until some one got tired. It would
be so much more convenient for showing John
the sights. And, as Madeline observed, pretty
nearly everything in London is a sight in one
way or another, so that it was really lunch-time
when John and Babe, who were ahead,
suddenly turned down a dark little alley and
waited at the corner for the rest to come up.</p>

<p>“Is the ‘Cheshire Cheese’ in here?” asked
the fastidious Babbie doubtfully. “Well,
this certainly looks like a splendid place for
ghosts,” she added, diving down the alley
after the others.</p>

<p>John pointed ahead to the quaint old
swinging sign that read “Ye Old Cheshire
Cheese.” It was a tiny little inn, the one
small dining-room opening right on to the
street. A waiter came bustling forward to
meet the party.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said John gravely, looking
inquiringly around the room. “Which
is Dr. Johnson’s chair, please?”</p>

<p>The waiter bowed and pointed to a seat in
one corner against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see, he’s not here yet,” said John
solemnly. “We were hoping to find him.
Well, I suppose we’d better sit down and have
something to eat while we wait.” He led the
way to the doctor’s table.</p>

<p>The waiter, wearing a perplexed expression,
pulled out the chairs,&mdash;John insisting that
Dr. Johnson’s seat should be left vacant,&mdash;and
recited the menu for the day.</p>

<p>“Which are the Doctor’s favorite dishes?”
John asked him.</p>

<p>“Hi really couldn’t say, sir.” The waiter’s
tone was full of mild reproach. “The lark-pie
his our special dish, sir, and the stewed
cheese his hexcellent heatin’ and a general
favorite.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have those, shan’t we, girls?”
asked John. “And bring enough for Dr.
Johnson, in case he should look in,” he added
gravely, and the waiter went off, shaking his
head and murmuring something about “those
mad Hamericans.”</p>

<p>“I want to sit in Dr. Johnson’s chair,”
complained Babbie, when he had gone.
“There’s no sense in saving a place for a ghost,
John. Don’t you know that they can sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
where there is somebody just as well as where
there isn’t?”</p>

<p>“That may be,” admitted John. “But I
consider that it’s more respectful. Speaking
of ghosts, is that the ghost of Billy Benson
that I see before me, or is it Billy in person?”</p>

<p>John tumbled his chair over in his eagerness
to get to the door and wring the hand of
a tall, broad-shouldered youth, who seemed
just as delighted to see John as John was to
see him. He had a friend with him, whom
John evidently did not know, for presently
Billy remembered him and summarily pulled
him forward to be introduced. Then the
three came over to the girls’ table.</p>

<p>“May I present Mr. William Benson?”
John began. “Best fellow in the world,
Billy is. Rooms in my hall at Harvard.
And this is Mr. Trevelyan, a friend of Billy’s.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trevelyan was several years older than
John or Billy. He was tall, dark, and slender,
with a distinguished manner, queer, near-sighted
gray eyes that were slightly out of
focus, making it hard to tell just where he
was looking, and a very peculiar way of speaking&mdash;it
was difficult to decide whether he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
a slight foreign accent or an impediment in
his speech.</p>

<p>“You fellows will join us, won’t you?”
asked John hospitably. “Mr. Trevelyan, you
can have Dr. Johnson’s seat, and Billy, you
can be Boswell and squeeze in somewhere, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Trevelyan demurred politely.
“You have found friends,” he told Billy. “I
insist that you let me withdraw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” said John decisively, and
when Babbie seconded the invitation, Mr.
Trevelyan allowed himself to be persuaded to
stay.</p>

<p>“You see the Doctor did come,” John announced
triumphantly to the waiter, when
that functionary reappeared with the lark-pie
and stewed cheese. “And Boswell is with
him, so you’d better bring us something
extra.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said the waiter, smiling
condescendingly at the absurdity of the
“Hamericans,” and Babbie overheard a rosy-cheeked
English girl at the next table say she
did wish people wouldn’t persist in treating
England as if it were a queer, old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
toy that it was fun to spend your summers
playing with.</p>

<p>“Come, John, you mustn’t tease that poor
waiter any more,” she commanded. “Mr.
Trevelyan and Mr. Benson don’t even know
why you’re doing it.”</p>

<p>So John explained to his guests that they
had unwittingly joined a ghost-hunt, and then
the girls told about the Dunstaffnage ghost,
and Mr. Trevelyan followed their story up
with an account of a ghost he had seen in the
Australian cattle-country.</p>

<p>He was an Australian, he explained, and
John, who was tremendously interested in
queer, out-of-the-way places, kept him busy
telling his experiences in the bush all through
luncheon. He told his stories so well that
every one else stopped talking to listen, and
they sat over their luncheon long after every
one else had left.</p>

<p>“Goodness, but you’ve had an interesting
life, Mr. Trevelyan,” said Madeline, when
they finally rose to go. “Aren’t you crazy to
get back to Australia? Everything else must
seem tame after that.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trevelyan bowed gravely in acknowledgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of her interest. “I shall not go back
at present. My widowed sister and I are
planning to settle down near Paris. We have
bought a house, and she is already in France,
visiting a friend. As soon as I have finished
a little business that I have here I shall join
her and we will set up housekeeping. And
now I must really leave you. I have a business
engagement.”</p>

<p>“All right, old man,” said Billy gaily.
“Only don’t forget to turn up for dinner and
the theatre.”</p>

<p>“Unless you wish to postpone&mdash;&mdash;” began
Mr. Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” Billy assured him. “Perhaps
Morton will join us. His hotel is near
ours.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trevelyan murmured something about
its being a great pleasure to have met them
all and hurried away.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he great?” said Billy eagerly. “He’s
the most modest fellow you ever saw. Never
mentions his own part in all those woolly
Australian tales until you quiz him, and then
you find he was ‘it’ every time. Now I happen
to know that his sister is visiting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
countess, but you notice he was careful to say
just ‘a friend.’”</p>

<p>“If he’d said a countess it would have been
blowing,” said John decidedly. “No nice
fellow would have lugged in the countess in that
connection. How’d you meet him, Billy?”</p>

<p>“On the street,” laughed Billy. “He asked
me the way to the Army and Navy Club.
When I told him, he noticed I was an American,
of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off, Billy,” John broke in.
“He’d know that the minute he set eyes on
you.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know it till I spoke,” persisted
Billy. “You see he doesn’t belong here&mdash;hasn’t
been in London before for fifteen years.
Well, anyhow he said he was glad an American
could tell him what he’d asked half a
dozen Englishmen who couldn’t. Then we
walked on together a bit, and found we were
both traveling alone and seeing the sights,
and I asked him to meet me for dinner. Then
we went to the Tower together, and out to
Kew Gardens, and then he moved to my hotel
and we rather joined forces. He’s an awfully
good sort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that he is,” agreed John
heartily.</p>

<p>“The way he speaks interests me,” said
Madeline. “Was he born in England? Were
his parents both English, do you know?”</p>

<p>Billy nodded. “Australians get to speaking
queerly, he says.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” agreed Madeline, “but I
should have been almost positive that he was
French.”</p>

<p>“He lisps,” declared Babe. “That’s one
thing that adds to the queerness of his talk.
Well, what are we going to do next?”</p>

<p>“We might pursue the ghost of Dr. Johnson
to his grave in Westminster Abbey,” suggested
Madeline. “Graveyards are the logical
places to hunt ghosts in, I suppose.”</p>

<p>But John objected. “The very reason I
chose Dr. Johnson was so we wouldn’t have
to go to any musty old churchyards. I
haven’t any use for them or for picture-galleries.
Let’s go up to the American Express
Office, and by that time it will be late enough
to pursue your specialty, Miss Ayres, and
drink tea somewhere.”</p>

<p>Billy Benson accepted with alacrity an invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
to join the tea-party. On the way to
the Express Office he told Babbie something
about his plans for the summer.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m on the Harvard crew,” he
explained, “and they’re all coming over later
to have a month’s practice on the course here.
We row Cambridge in the fall, you know.”</p>

<p>Babbie didn’t know, and inquired eagerly
when and where the race was to come off.</p>

<p>“Why, right here, on the regular course up
near Hampton,” Billy told her, “and early in
September, just before college opens. It’s going
to be simply great. Can’t you manage to
be on hand?”</p>

<p>Babbie explained that they were going over
to France and had meant to sail for home from
a French port. “But there isn’t any reason
why we shouldn’t come back to England first,”
she declared. “I’m going to ask mother if we
can’t do that. We could leave a week earlier
now, and have a week here in September.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying,” Billy took up his
own story, “my roommate was coming with
me in June, but he caught the measles from
his kid brother&mdash;wasn’t that the complete
limit of a thing to do?&mdash;so I just came along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
alone. I was afraid if I waited over another
boat for him, my guardian might change his
mind about letting me go.” Billy smiled
pensively. “He can change his mind all he
likes now. I’m twenty-one. My birthday
was yesterday and I celebrated by cabling
home for more money. You see,” he added
confidentially, “I’m having some clothes
made by a Bond Street tailor.”</p>

<p>Babbie laughed. “They say what women
come abroad for is to buy clothes, but I didn’t
suppose men cared much about shopping over
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, the point is that I didn’t bring over
any glad rags,” Billy explained. “Didn’t expect
to need any, just knocking about by myself.
But I’m going to run over to Paris when
Trevelyan goes&mdash;I shall have just time to see
the town before the crew gets here&mdash;and the
countess that his sister is visiting is going to
give a dance for her just about that time.
Trevelyan insists that she’ll want me to come,
when she hears from him that I’m with him,
and so of course I’ve got to have the proper
things ready.”</p>

<p>“How exciting,” laughed Babbie, “to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
going to a countess’s ball. Madeline has a
cousin who is a viscountess, but she’s not in
Paris just now, and I’m afraid that spoils our
only chance of breaking into titled society.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had reached the Express
Office, and John demanded his mail and received
the expected missive from his father
with a grin of rapture.</p>

<p>“Excuse me while I read this,” he said,
waving it triumphantly aloft and retiring in
haste to a quiet corner.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was back, the letter
and the smile both out of sight.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said grimly. “Let’s go and
drown our sorrows in tea.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Babe inquired sympathetically,
when the party had paired off to
walk to a tea-shop that Madeline knew of on
Regent Street. “Wasn’t he as pleased as you
thought he would be?”</p>

<p>“Pleased!” repeated John gloomily. “He
wasn’t pleased at all. He told me in polite
language that Dwight had lied about me, and
insinuated that I’d put him up to it, because
I wanted to get something out of my father.
He says he had a very high opinion of Dwight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
when he hired him in the spring, but he sees
now that he’s only an ‘amiable futility,’ like all
the other tutors I’ve had. Then he ended by
saying that when he wanted information
about my mental capacity he would ask for
it, and that if I couldn’t get along with the
allowance we settled on when I came across, I
would just have to cut down my expenses.”</p>

<p>“What a shame!” Babe’s voice was full of
righteous indignation. “And you didn’t
want any more money, did you?”</p>

<p>“I should say not! Why, I saved a lot
while we were staying in Oban. Besides I
wouldn’t take that way to get it,&mdash;I’d ask
right out, as I generally do. It’s so maddening
to have him always assume as a matter of
course that a fellow’s in the wrong.”</p>

<p>“Is he that way about everything?”</p>

<p>John nodded. “I told you how he hated this
vacation that he’s taking. He enjoys grumbling
over things as much as you or I enjoy
laughing about them.”</p>

<p>“Just like the funny old gentleman we
met in Grasmere,” said Babe. “Why, John,
is your father’s name Jasper J. Morton?”</p>

<p>John nodded. “Just suits him, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Why, then he was the very one we met.”
Babe laughed delightedly. “Didn’t I write
you anything about it? Well, it was this
way.” She gave a brief sketch of the encounter,
ending with, “He may be hard to
get along with sometimes, John, but he’s an
old dear just the same. Betty thinks so,
too. She saw more of him than I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t hit it off somehow, he and
I.” John’s tone was as gloomy as ever. “I
feel sometimes as if I might as well stop trying
to please him. Makes you envy a chap
like Billy Benson who’s always done about
as he pleased and now is absolutely his own
master. I’m six months older than Billy,
but my being of age doesn’t make the least
difference in the way my father treats me,
and now I’ve done my level best this summer,
and that hasn’t made the least difference
either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it must in the end,” Babe reassured
him cheerfully. “You’ll feel better
after you’ve had some tea.”</p>

<p>But John refused to be cheered, though
Billy Benson and Madeline gave absurd
imitations of English people taking tea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Billy read a thrilling letter from the captain
of the Harvard crew, which made all the
girls as eager as Babbie had been to come
back in September for the race.</p>

<p>“I shan’t see that race,” John confided in
low tones to Babe. “I bet you all the
money I saved in Oban against your blue
tie that my father chooses that particular
day to sail from Liverpool.”</p>

<p>“I never bet,” Babe returned laughingly.
“But if I see your father again&mdash;he told us
he hoped we might meet somewhere over
in France&mdash;I’ll mention the race and invite
him to take me to it.”</p>

<p>“But if I go, I shall want to take you
myself,” objected John.</p>

<p>“Humph!” observed Babe, “it seems to
me that Mr. Jasper J. Morton has not monopolized
all the contrariety there is in the
family.”</p>

<span class="smaller">BETTY WALES, DETECTIVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Billy Benson</span> lost no time in accepting
the girls’ invitation to call on them. On the
evening of the day after the ghost-hunt that
developed into a tea-drinking, Billy appeared,
arrayed in the “glad rags” that he had
cajoled his Bond Street tailor into finishing
long before the stipulated time. Finding that
Mrs. Hildreth was hesitating a little about
including the Harvard-Cambridge race in
her itinerary, he set himself to cajole her&mdash;with
equal success. First he told funny
stories to make her laugh; then he unearthed
the fact that his mother and she had been
girlhood friends; then he alluded casually
to English sports, and offered to take her to
a cricket-match the next afternoon; finally
he smiled his famous smile and asked her
if she honestly wouldn’t like to see that
race he had told the girls about. Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
he wanted to row his very best, for the honor
of Harvard and the United States of America;
and he could do any amount better if he
knew that some good friends of his would be
watching him and cheering for the crimson.
Whereupon Mrs. Hildreth laughed at his
ingenious reasoning and commissioned Babbie
and Madeline to see about engaging passage
back from an English port. And Billy,
thanking her with charming deference, and
taking an early and ceremonious leave, reflected,
as he often had before, that it was
easy enough to get things your way if you
only took a little pains to be agreeable.</p>

<p>John Morton, on the other hand, bitterly
regretted the girls’ change of plan. “I know
I shan’t be here for the race,” he told Babe,
“and I can’t go over to Paris when you do,
because old Dwight won’t be through with
his reading at the British Museum. I might
skip off with Billy, I suppose, but my father
would be furious if he ever found it out.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t do that,” Babe advised him.
“It wouldn’t be the square thing at all. Besides,
we’re not going straight to Paris.
We’re going to Saint something. I forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the name, but it’s a seaside place up in
Brittany. Madeline says it’s lovely. So you
may get to Paris as soon as we do after all.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. Anyway I think you ought to
go sight-seeing in London now and not waste
time over shopping. You can do that just as
well in September when I’m not here.”</p>

<p>“And in that way we won’t have the things
we buy to lug around in the meantime,”
added Babe; but it is doubtful if this practical
consideration had very much to do with
the sudden subsidence of her shopping mania.</p>

<p>Of course Babe told all the girls that Jasper
J. Morton, the Grasmere automobilist, and
John’s father were one and the same person.
But only to Betty did she confide the
story of the letter that had so disheartened
John.</p>

<p>“I wish I were like you,” she said; “then
I should know how to give him the right kind
of advice.”</p>

<p>“Why, I should think the only thing to
say was that he ought to try to make his
father see that he’s trying,” began Betty
doubtfully. “You can’t expect a person to
believe right off that you are going to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
hard, when you’ve always wasted your time
before. Goodness, don’t you remember how
long it took Eleanor Watson to get back her
reputation? You just wouldn’t believe in her
yourself, Babe.”</p>

<p>“That was very different. She&mdash;she wasn’t
honest. Besides, if I’d been her father I’d
have stuck by her.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled at Babe’s easy assumptions.
“You can’t tell what you’d have done. But,
anyhow, don’t feel so bad about it. They’ll
just have to get along as they always have before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they won’t!” Babe’s tone was
tragic. “They&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Betty, I’ve just got
to tell some one. John says he simply can’t
stand it any longer. He’s talked to Mr. Benson
about it, and he has been asking Mr.
Trevelyan about the chances for a young man
in Australia. Mr. Benson has some kind of
a big business that his guardian is managing
for him until he’s through college, and he
says he will ask the guardian to give John a
position there. But John thinks Australia
would be better, because you can always earn
more in a wild country, and then besides, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
his father objected, he would be away off
there and he could just go ahead with his
plans.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Babe, how silly! Then he doesn’t
want to finish his college course, after all the
time he’s spent tutoring?”</p>

<p>Babe shook her head. “He doesn’t want
to do that anyway. He says it will be only a
waste of time. Whatever he does, he wants
to go right to work. He’d be perfectly satisfied
if his father would let him go to work in
his business.”</p>

<p>“But what’s his dreadful hurry?” demanded
Betty. “As long as his father wants
him to finish college why doesn’t he do it, and
then go to work? If he’s really in earnest
about trying to please his father that’s what
he ought to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you see a year is a lot of time to
lose, when you might be getting started in
business. He wouldn’t expect his father to
support him&mdash;that is, we wouldn’t want&mdash;we
couldn’t&mdash;&mdash;” Babe paused, blushing
furiously. “Oh, Betty, don’t you see how it
is? You’ve just screwed it out of me. Promise
you won’t tell anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Of course not,” laughed Betty. “A nice
consistent man-hater you are, Babe.”</p>

<p>“But Betty, I haven’t decided anything
yet,” Babe protested hastily. “I may decide
to go on being a man-hater just the same.
Anyway John is only the exception that
proves the rule.”</p>

<p>“Well, certainly, Babe,” Betty went on
seriously, “you wouldn’t want him to have
any trouble with his father on your account.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Babe earnestly. “I
couldn’t bear to have him do that. That’s
why it all worries me so.”</p>

<p>“Then why not tell him that you think he
ought to stick to college and try to please his
father, whatever happens?”</p>

<p>Babe considered, frowning. “I will. A
year isn’t so terribly long, when you’re young.
I’ll&mdash;yes, I’ll tell him that if he doesn’t decide
to go back to college and do his best to make
his father happy why I’ll just return his
cairngorm pin.”</p>

<p>The few remaining days of the girls’ stay in
London flew swiftly by. It was the regular
thing for John to join them for a part of each
day. Sometimes when he was not too busy at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
the British Museum, Mr. Dwight came too.
Billy Benson, who was an indefatigable sight-seer,
divided his time between John and the
girls and Mr. Trevelyan, who kept modestly
in the background, always ready if Billy
wanted his society, and always having “business”
to attend to when Billy was otherwise
engaged. Billy, who was an impressionable
youth, was forever singing his new friend’s
praises.</p>

<p>“He’s so thoughtful and considerate,” he
declared to Babbie one morning. “My invitation
to the countess’s dance came this morning.”
He held out a daintily engraved card.
“What did he do but write to his sister to see
if I might bring you along. No, I didn’t suggest
it. It was all his own idea. He said
that his sister would be the only woman there
who spoke English, and as the guest of honor
she’ll be busy of course. And as I can’t ‘parlez-vous’
one small word, he’s afraid I’ll be
bored&mdash;or a bore. Would you come?”</p>

<p>Babbie wasn’t sure that they would be in
Paris in time for the dance. Even if they
were she hadn’t any evening dress with her,
and anyway, she was afraid her mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
wouldn’t be willing that she should go.
“But it was fine of him to think of it,” she
ended. “I’m going to ask mother if she
minds his joining us on the trip to Hampton
Court.”</p>

<p>The Hampton Court expedition was to furnish
the grand finale for the London chapter
of “B. A.’s Abroad.” They were to go up to
Hampton by an early afternoon train, see the
palace and gardens, have dinner at an inn
with a fascinating name just outside the palace
gates, and row down the river at sunset, taking
a train back to London somewhere further
down the line. Mrs. Hildreth was going to
chaperon the party, and she had no objection
to Babbie’s asking Mr. Trevelyan to join it.
She shook her head, however, over the invitation
to the countess’s dance. “You couldn’t
go without a chaperon, dear,” she said. “And
if the idea is that Mr. Trevelyan’s sister is to
chaperon you, why I shouldn’t be at all willing
unless I had met her beforehand.”</p>

<p>Billy assured her easily that all those details
could be arranged. “Don’t say no until
you have to,” he begged. “I’m afraid
Trevelyan will be discouraged at the prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of my dumbness and try to get out of taking
me. Besides, it would be such a jolly lark if
you came.”</p>

<p>So the matter was left in abeyance for the
moment. Billy, in his casual way, told Mr.
Trevelyan that Mrs. Hildreth hoped she could
meet his sister before the dance, and Mr.
Trevelyan bowed gravely and said his sister
would certainly do herself the honor of calling
on Mrs. Hildreth.</p>

<p>He bowed gravely again as he accepted
Babbie’s invitation to go with them to Hampton
Court. He seemed very familiar with the
place, and John and Billy, who found English
time-tables and tram-lines very confusing,
sighed relieved sighs and let him direct the
party.</p>

<p>“It’s fine having him along,” Billy declared.
“He always knows where things are and
how you get there and what there is to see.
He’s as good as a regular guide, and at the
same time he’s an addition to the party.”</p>

<p>“Without being an additional expense,”
laughed John. “Pays his own way, doesn’t
he?”</p>

<p>Billy nodded. “We sort of take turns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
If I pay for our luncheons, he pays for dinner.
Then I pay for the theatre and so on.
It evens up in the end, and it’s less trouble
among friends.”</p>

<p>“This expedition is to be a Dutch treat, you
know,” John explained. “Babbie insisted
that it must be that way.”</p>

<p>Billy felt in his pockets absently. “By
George, that’s lucky for me, because I forgot to
get a check cashed this morning. Can you
lend me a little?”</p>

<p>John laughed. “I can’t. I forgot too, and
I shall be doing well if I get back to London
with a ’bus fare.”</p>

<p>They were standing on the terrace at Hampton
Court, overlooking the river, with its gay
row of house-boats anchored to the opposite
shore. Trevelyan was with the girls and Mrs.
Hildreth, pointing out the different boats and
telling the names of their owners.</p>

<p>“I say, Trevelyan,” Billy hailed him, “can
you finance me for the day, and maybe John,
too? We’ve forgotten to get any checks
cashed.”</p>

<p>Trevelyan smiled. “I think I can accommodate
you, if you don’t want too much. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
carry express checks, too?” He looked at
John.</p>

<p>“All good Americans do,” declared John.</p>

<p>“Except me,” Babbie put in. “I carry
gold certificates.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not say that too loud,”
laughed John. “With your gold certificates,
and that ring”&mdash;pointing at the sparkling
hoop of diamonds that had been Babbie’s
father’s last present to her and that she always
wore&mdash;“you’d be a valuable prey for brigands.”
He pointed to the shadowy length of Queen
Mary’s “pleached walk” just behind them.
“These European show-places swarm with
adventurers. How do you know that Trevelyan
isn’t one, and that he isn’t planning to
drag you off to that pleached walk after dinner
and rob you?”</p>

<p>Babbie laughed. “I’m not afraid. But
it is queer, isn’t it, how the first subject of
conversations among travelers is always, ‘How
do you carry your money?’ I’ve told lots
of people how I carry mine.” She turned to
Trevelyan. “I told you the very first time I
met you.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” asked Trevelyan absently. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
don’t remember. Shall we go and walk in
Mary’s bower, Miss Hildreth?”</p>

<p>Babbie had not liked Mr. Trevelyan particularly
before, but he was so entertaining this
afternoon that she was secretly annoyed when
she found herself paired off with Mr. Dwight
for the long row down the river. Mr. Trevelyan
was with Betty, who always got on
beautifully with Mr. Dwight. But it couldn’t
be helped, so Babbie settled herself to enjoy
the river and make the best of her rather
prosy companion. The river was crowded
with pleasure-craft&mdash;motor-boats, launches,
rowboats, and punts. These last fascinated
Betty, because they were different from anything
in America.</p>

<p>“I like all these nice slow English things,”
she told Mr. Trevelyan. “Can you punt?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “But don’t you notice that
in punting the girl nearly always does the
work?” He held his oars in one hand and
pointed to a boat that was coming up-stream
near the other bank. As he did so, he turned
to face it and the man who was lolling on the
cushions recognized him and sat up suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“How are you, Lestrange?” he called
across the water. “Haven’t seen you in
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Quite well, thanks. I’ve been awfully
busy,” Trevelyan called back, and picking up
his oars began pulling off with long steady
strokes that speedily put distance between
himself and the punt. But he could row and
talk, too. He seemed bent on being as agreeable
to Betty as, earlier in the afternoon, he
had to Babbie. When they reached the landing-place
that had been appointed as a rendezvous
he still kept close beside her, and on
the train and the ’bus he was a most attentive
escort. Betty, who was very sleepy, wished
at last that he would talk to somebody else
and let her have a little cat-nap in peace. She
also wanted to ask John or Billy Benson
whether his first name was Lestrange, but she
couldn’t, with him close beside her. Very
likely Babbie or Babe would know. It was
certainly a queer first name.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to see us off in the morning?”
asked Babbie, as the men made ready to say
good-night. “John, you will, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” returned John stiffly, avoiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Babbie’s eyes. “Quarter to ten is very
early for London.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted Billy Benson cheerfully.
“I’ll get you up in time. I’m coming
to the station, and so is Trevelyan, aren’t
you, old man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Trevelyan, who was
still standing close by Betty.</p>

<p>“Well, did everybody have a good time?”
asked Madeline, when they were indoors.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Babbie quickly, “until I got
caught with Mr. Dwight.”</p>

<p>“I did,” agreed Betty, “until I got sleepy
and kept yawning in Mr. Trevelyan’s face, in
spite of myself. By the way, a queer thing
happened while we were rowing down the
river. Do any of you happen to know his
first name?”</p>

<p>“It’s Arthur,” said Babbie promptly. “I
saw it on the invitation that Mr. Benson had
to the countess’s ball. It was addressed in
care of Mr. Arthur Trevelyan.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer.” Betty repeated what the
man in the punt had said.</p>

<p>“Probably Lestrange is his second name,”
suggested Madeline. “The invitation might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
have read L. Arthur or Arthur L. Babbie
wouldn’t have noticed the initial.”</p>

<p>“But just suppose it isn’t,” Betty argued.
“I thought he looked queer, and tried to
hurry away, though that may all have been
my imagination; but anyhow it would have
been the most natural thing in the world for
him to have explained.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t think of explaining if it
is his other name,” Madeline persisted, “any
more than Babe would think of explaining if
some one happened to call her Sarah. However,
of course Mr. Benson doesn’t really
know anything about him. Let’s suppose he
is an adventurer, with aliases and deep-laid
schemes for separating the boys from their
money. You’d better write and warn them,
Betty.”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Betty, you ought,” added Babe,
thinking of John’s Australian schemes, which
depended more or less on Mr. Trevelyan’s coöperation.</p>

<p>“We shall see them all in the morning,”
Babbie reminded them. “And please don’t
say anything to mother until you’re sure.
She’ll be so horrified to think that she allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
her innocent young daughter and her daughter’s
little friends to go around London in
such dreadful company.”</p>

<p>So Betty decided to wait until morning.
But though the girls scanned the platform
anxiously until the train pulled out of the
station no one appeared to see them off.</p>

<p>“I knew they wouldn’t come,” Babe confided
in savage tones to Betty. “At least I
knew John wouldn’t. I did what I told you
I would, and he was perfectly horrid&mdash;said it
was just like a girl to want to decide everything,
and that of course he’d like to please
me, but he must do what he thought was best.
So I gave him back his old cairngorm, and
there isn’t any exception to the rule of man-hating,
after all. And I’m perfectly miserable,
so there now!”</p>

<p>Several days later Babbie got a note from
John, forwarded from her Paris address,
which seemed to disprove Babe’s theory.
They had all three gone to see the girls off,
he explained, but Mr. Trevelyan had for once
proved unreliable; he had made an unaccountable
mistake about the station, which
John had discovered too late to correct. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
they had waited for the girls at Paddington
while the girls watched for them in Waterloo.
“He got us there an hour early too,” John
wrote. “Insisted that you said eight forty-five
instead of nine. And we were all awfully
sleepy, because after we left you we took a
long ’bus ride through the East End and then
stopped on the Embankment for supper.
Dwight hasn’t finished reading through the
British Museum, so I don’t know when we
may get to Paris. However, I still find London
very interesting”&mdash;a conclusion which
made everybody but Babe smile.</p>

<p>This letter crossed with Betty’s note, telling
John about the name by which some of Mr.
Trevelyan’s English friends knew him; so of
course it threw no light on the subject. The
girls watched eagerly for another letter, all
through the week they spent at Saint Malo,
but none came. However, as Madeline remarked,
Saint Malo was quite fascinating
enough without any adventurer stalking
through its streets, and besides, one didn’t
need to speculate about imaginary adventures
when you were living in the midst of real
ones.</p>

<span class="smaller">JASPER J. MORTON AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Maxim</span> for travelers: Always begin your
first trip to France at Saint Malo,” announced
Betty Wales, after they had explored the
quaint old town a little. Babbie and Madeline,
the traveled contingent, agreed that it
was “just as dear and almost as dirty” as anything
in Italy, which was Madeline’s standard
of real charm. Babe, being in a state of subdued
and pensive melancholy, said nothing
and thought a great deal&mdash;but not about Saint
Malo. Madeline and Babbie supposed she was
missing John until Babe, unable to endure
their constant chaffing any longer, informed
them curtly that she never wished to see him
again as long as she lived. Having freed her
mind, she felt a little better; but she sternly
rejected sympathy, even from Betty, refused to
confide in Babbie, though the B’s had always
told one another everything, and spent most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
of her time on the hotel piazza facing the sea,
sitting in one of the hooded beach chairs that
abound at all the continental watering-places.
The hood of this particular one was lined with
pink flowered cretonne, and it was so becoming
that Babbie declared it was a perfect shame
the effect should be lost.</p>

<p>“John would do anything she wanted if he
could see her in that chair,” she declared.
“As for her not wanting to see him, she’s
simply dying to this very minute. Won’t it
be interesting watching them make up in
Paris?”</p>

<p>“Almost as interesting as it is watching
Betty buy post-cards in French,” laughed
Madeline.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if I am funny,” declared Betty
stoutly. “I’m learning. I can say almost
anything I want to now, only I have to look
up some words in my dictionary. I’ve written
my family that you can learn more French
here in a week than you do in a year at
Harding.”</p>

<p>“That’s a base slander on Harding,” returned
Madeline promptly. “Here you are
engaging the entire time of two excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
tutors,&mdash;meaning me and Miss Hildreth,&mdash;besides
getting incidental instruction from nearly
every inhabitant of the town. You ought to
be learning a little something, my child.”</p>

<p>“You never bought a dictionary either, at
Harding,” put in Babbie. “You used to borrow
Nita’s.”</p>

<p>Betty’s diminutive French dictionary had
been her first purchase in Saint Malo. In the
crowd of porters and custom-house officials on
the landing-wharf she had discovered that she
knew even less French than she had supposed,
and Madeline’s and Babbie’s easy intercourse
with the hotel servants and shop-keepers filled
her with envy and despair.</p>

<p>“I will learn,” she declared. “I never
wanted to particularly before, but now I want
to more than anything. I won’t be carried
along on this trip like a piece of baggage,
having to call one of you whenever I want to
ask for hot water or buy a postage stamp.”</p>

<p>So she bought her dictionary and carried it
with her everywhere, bringing it out on all
occasions, to the intense amusement of Babbie
and Madeline, who criticised her accent
mercilessly, taught her the most complicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
idioms they could remember, and assisted her
progress by making her inquire the way about
the town, do their shopping as well as her
own, and even flounder through protracted
interviews with the fat and obtuse old woman
who rented bath-houses and suits on the rocks
just below the wall that encircled the town.
With such strenuous practice it was certainly
no wonder, as Madeline had pointed out, that
Betty’s progress was rapid.</p>

<p>Saint Malo is a tiny, sleepy town, shut in by
a great wall. Its narrow, crooked streets are
lined with tall stone houses, there is a lovely
old church towering over everything, and on
all sides, when the tide is high, is the sea. At
low tide there are great stretches of ugly yellow
sand flats, where it is not safe to walk
because of treacherous quicksands, and over
which the incoming sea rushes “faster than a
horse can gallop,” so the natives tell you
proudly. But there are small bathing beaches
close to the wall; there is the wall to promenade
on; there are the dark, stuffy little shops
in the town where one buys Brittany ware and
Cluny lace, all “très bon marché,” of bright-eyed
peasant women in caps and sabots; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
everywhere there is the fascinating foreign atmosphere
that is, after all, the crowning feature
in the charm of traveling.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad we aren’t automobiling this
time!” sighed Babbie. “James wouldn’t
have let us come here. He’d have fussed
about the roads or the garages or something
of that sort. I hope we shall have time for
some more little out-of-the-way villages.”</p>

<p>“There are dozens in this neighborhood,”
the “man from Cook’s” assured her. “We
ought to be energetic and take some side-trips.
We can go to Dinard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s where I want to go,” broke in Mrs.
Hildreth. “I’ve heard so much about what
a gay, pretty little place it is. Is it hard to
get there, Madeline?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” responded Madeline, “only
if we’re going to-day we ought to start in a
few minutes and have lunch there, because
the tide is low about noon, and at low tide
the ferry-boat doesn’t run, or if it does it
starts from some inconvenient place.”</p>

<p>“Then if Dinard is dressy, I can’t go,” said
Betty sadly. “Every one of my thin waists is
torn, and it takes ages to mend them nicely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“Then why don’t you come over in the
afternoon and meet us there?” suggested
Madeline. “The pretty French girl who
sits opposite us at table d’hôte says that there
is a Casino where they have music in the
afternoons. People motor in from the châteaux,
and it’s great fun sitting on the piazzas
and watching the gaiety. I’ll wait and come
with you, if you like.”</p>

<p>But Betty insisted that she could go perfectly
well alone. “I can say, ‘Ou est le
casino?’ beautifully,” she declared, “and
if I don’t understand a word of the answer
why I can just watch which way they point.
The lovely thing about French people is that
they always point. I’ll mend all my waists
and take the ferry about four, or whenever
the tide is right, and meet you at the
Casino.”</p>

<p>And so at half-past three,&mdash;because, to tell
the truth, it was easier to be a little early
than to ask the hotel clerk about the tide,&mdash;Betty,
dressed in her prettiest white suit and
her hat with the pink roses, came out of the
hotel and started down the road to the ferry
landing. It was a hot day and the road was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
dusty, and she hurried as fast as possible to
get into the shelter of the little park just
back of the landing. But before she reached
it she heard a shout from the bottom of the
landing-steps, and the next minute she realized
that somebody was calling her,&mdash;a stout
gentleman, who, having detached himself
from the little crowd that had gathered there,
was laboriously climbing the steps to meet
her, still calling and beckoning frantically as
he came. But instead of using her name he
was shouting, “Miss B. A.! Miss B. A.!”
And this, before he was near enough to be
recognized, gave Betty the clue to his identity.
It was Jasper J. Morton, of course.</p>

<p>His coat was off, he carried his hat in his
hand, and his face was red with heat and indignation.</p>

<p>“Do you speak English?” he demanded,
when he was near enough to be heard. “I
mean do you speak French? I’ve been tearing
around asking people if they speak English
until I’m hoarse.”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to see you again,” said
Betty, holding out her hand and trying not
to smile at the absurd figure he cut. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
speak only a little bit of French, but fortunately
I have my dictionary along,”&mdash;she
pulled the little book out of a pocket in her
linen coat&mdash;“and with that I can generally
manage pretty well.”</p>

<p>“The point is,” Mr. Morton broke in impatiently,
“do you speak French enough to
ascertain what has happened to this confounded
ferry? I came over here this morning
from a place called Dinard. I came by
ferry. I climbed those identical steps.” He
waved his hand dramatically toward the
landing. “I lunched and strolled around
the town until it was nearly time for me to
meet my chauffeur in Dinard. Then I came
back here. The ferry is gone. The ocean is
gone. Am I out of my senses, or what’s
happened?” He mopped his brow and glowered
darkly at Betty.</p>

<p class="p2b">“The ferry hasn’t gone for good,” she assured
him soothingly, “nor the ocean. In a
few minutes they’ll both be back and we can
go to Dinard together. I’m waiting for the
ferry too.” And she explained about the
tides, which necessitated the intermittent
service.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo4"><img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="400" alt="“I HAVE MY DICTIONARY”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“I HAVE MY DICTIONARY”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Jasper J. Morton stared out across the great
stretch of bare sand. “Do you mean to tell
me that in a few minutes all that will be under
water enough to float a good-sized ferry-boat?
Well, these tides must be French, like
all the rest of it. In that case it’s lucky I
didn’t try to walk out to the edge of the
water to see if I couldn’t find a boat there.”
He looked at his watch. “I’m two hours late
now. I’m never late for my appointments.
My chauffeur won’t know what to make of it.
He can’t speak French either, so he won’t be
able to ask any questions.”</p>

<p>Betty laughed. “You ought to get a dictionary
like mine. It’s very useful. Can I
do anything else for you, Mr. Morton?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton looked at her sharply. “You
can. You can come down the steps with me
and tell the man who insists on holding my
coat that I don’t want a guide, philosopher
and friend, or whatever else he’s trying to be
to me, but that I do want my coat. Pay
him off with these.” He handed her some
silver.</p>

<p>With some difficulty Betty made the man
understand that “le monsieur Anglais” did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
not want a guide for the afternoon, nor a boatman,
nor a porter.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Jasper J. Morton briskly,
“comes the real business of the moment.
I’ve got to send some telegrams to Dol, where
I’m stopping and where I was to meet two
friends on business at five o’clock. I shan’t
be there at five. Is your French equal to finding
a telegraph office?”</p>

<p>Betty looked up several words in her dictionary,
asked a question or two, and they
started off. At the telegraph office Mr. Morton
wrote two messages just alike: “Unavoidably
detained. Back in evening. Clef
d’Or best hotel.”</p>

<p>“That will fix them,” he said, smiling
cheerfully at Betty. “They’ll spend the afternoon
in the sulks, thinking I’ve changed
my mind and won’t come in to their game.
Now see that he reads them right and tell
him to hurry them off, and then we can talk
English for a while.</p>

<p>“I’ve done everything to-day that my doctor
ordered me not to,” he told her when they
were on their way back to the ferry. “I’ve
worried about business, I’ve got overexcited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and overheated, I’ve lost my temper, and to-night
I’m going to do business&mdash;the biggest
deal I ever put through. You’ve been a
Benevolent Adventurer this time all right,
Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wales,” Betty supplied.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll have to call you Miss B. A.,”
he laughed. “By the way, how did you find
out my name?”</p>

<p>Betty had to think a minute. “Why, we
met a man in London who knows you, and
then we know your son.”</p>

<p>“You know John?” repeated Mr. Morton
irritably.</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “Don’t you remember I
told you when we met before what a good time
we had in Oban? Well, he was the one we
had it with&mdash;he and Mr. Dwight. Only I
didn’t know it then&mdash;I didn’t know he was
your son, I mean. And then in London we
met him again.”</p>

<p>“You did, eh?” Mr. Morton eyed her
sharply. “Met him again in London? Are
you at the bottom of this new leaf of his that
Dwight wrote me about, Miss B. A.?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Betty quickly, “but I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Babe is,&mdash;at least they got to be awfully good
friends, and she hates a shirk.”</p>

<p>“Babe&mdash;that’s the little tomboy who stood
up for you against me.” Mr. Morton laughed
at the recollection. “She’d be a match for
John. She’d make something of him if any
one could. But what she can see in him beats
me. Oh, he’s a pleasant fellow enough, but
he’ll never amount to that, Miss B. A.”
Jasper J. Morton snapped his fingers derisively.</p>

<p>They had come out on the water-front and
Betty, happening to look ahead, saw that the
tide had come in, and with it the ferry-boat,
which at that very moment gave a warning
whistle.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, we’ve missed the boat!” she
said, “and they only go once an hour.”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t,” cried Mr. Morton.
“What’s the French for ‘Wait’? You tell
me and I’ll shout it.” Which he did with
such effect that the captain reversed his engines
and put back for them.</p>

<p>“Attendez,” repeated Mr. Morton, when he
had settled himself on board and caught his
breath. “Hope I can remember that. It
will be sure to come in handy somewhere. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
haven’t any head for languages&mdash;never had.
Can’t talk to one of my foreign agents without
an interpreter.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer that your son should be so fine
at languages,” said Betty, glad to get in a
word in John’s favor. “We’ve always thought
that Madeline Ayres was perfectly remarkable,
but she says he is any amount more so.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Mr. Morton’s tone was unpleasantly
sceptical. “Well, I don’t know
that I ever paid a bill for a tutor in languages,
as far as that goes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, these aren’t the kinds you study at
college,” Betty explained, “or at least he
knows them too, I suppose; but I was thinking
of Dutch and Danish and Russian and
those queer kinds. He speaks ten different
ones, I think he said, and he can understand
a few words of some others.”</p>

<p>“This is all news to me,” said Jasper J.
Morton drily. “How’d he learn them?”</p>

<p>“Down on some wharves that you own,
he said. You do own some wharves, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton puckered his lips into a queer
smile. “Well, I’m surprised for once in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
life&mdash;agreeably surprised. I didn’t suppose
John had any useful accomplishments.”</p>

<p>Betty smiled engagingly. “Well, as long
as you didn’t know about this one, don’t you
suppose he has lots of others that you don’t
know about, either?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton laughed good-naturedly. “So
you think I’m inclined to look on the dark
side of things, do you, Miss B. A.? Well,
I’ll write the boy to-night, after I’ve scalped
those two railroad presidents, and tell him
that I hear good accounts of him. I say,
here we are at Dinard, and actually there’s
my chauffeur waiting for me. Waited because
it was the easiest thing to do, I suppose.
Now you must let me take you to
your friends, only you’ll have to ask the
way, because I can’t.”</p>

<p>As Betty waved him a good-bye from the
steps of the Casino she thought sadly of a
great many things she might have said about
John and hadn’t. “It’s so difficult when
you’ve been confided in and have to remember
what you mustn’t tell,” she thought.
“Oh, dear, I meant to explain about Mr.
Blake and what I told him. I forgot that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
too. I hope Mr. Morton won’t forget to write
the letter to his son.”</p>

<p>Her eyes followed Mr. Morton’s big red
car as it turned a corner, and there, walking
briskly toward her, his eyes absently fixed
on the ground, his cynical expression even
more pronounced than usual, was Mr. Richard
Blake himself.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> as Betty discovered Mr. Blake he
looked up and discovered her.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he inquired gaily,
striding across the street and up the steps
to shake hands. “I’m extra glad to see you
because I regard your appearance as a good
omen. You’ve got another scoop up your
sleeve for me, now haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you haven’t found
Mr. Morton yet?” demanded Betty, dispensing
with formal greetings in her haste
to explain Mr. Morton’s whereabouts.
“Why, you just met him, Mr. Blake. He
went around that corner just now in his
car.”</p>

<p>“The mischief he did!” Mr. Blake
turned and surveyed the corner ruefully.
“I was thinking of somebody&mdash;something
else. I didn’t know a car passed me. I say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
I suppose you haven’t any idea where he was
going?”</p>

<p>“To Dol. He told me he was staying
there.”</p>

<p>“He’ll change his mind on the way&mdash;I’ve
chased him long enough now to know his
habits. Still it’s worth trying. See here,
Miss Wales, don’t you want to come along
and introduce me,&mdash;or just countenance the
expedition by your presence? Jasper J.
hates newspaper men, and you might be a
lot of help. It won’t take ten minutes to
round him up. We can go in that car.” He
waved his hand at one drawn up by the
curbing.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll come,” agreed Betty, “only
I ought to go in and tell Mrs. Hildreth first.”</p>

<p>“No time,” objected Dick brusquely.
“Every minute counts.” He ran down
the steps and began cranking the engine
vigorously. “Get up in front beside me, so we
can talk.”</p>

<p>Betty hesitated an instant and then, reflecting
that ten minutes couldn’t matter
much, and wishing to be obliging, she jumped
in. Mr. Blake was beside her in an instant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
and before she had had time to button her
coat or pull her veil tight, they were fairly
whizzing down the hill.</p>

<p>“You don’t mind going fast, do you?”
asked Mr. Blake absently, his eyes on the
sharp rise beyond.</p>

<p>Betty’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “I
never went fast enough yet. I didn’t know
you had a car with you, Mr. Blake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t,” he explained quickly.
“This belongs to an old pal of mine&mdash;somebody
you know, by the way. Remember
Mrs. Bob, who chaperoned Madeline’s house-party?
Well, this is her husband’s car. You
remember him, too, and the awful daubs he
painted? We guyed him about them until
he took it to heart and went West to make his
fortune. Put all his money in a Texas oil
well, had beginner’s luck, and now he’s drawing
a thousand a week from that well. And
prosperity has improved his painting, too, until
he turns out very decent things. He’s
working in the garden next the Casino this
afternoon. I was to come for him about this
time, and we were going for a little spin in
the cool of the afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t he be worried about his car?”</p>

<p>“Probably, if he goes out to look for it,”
said Mr. Blake calmly. “But he ought to have
something to worry over. He’s getting disgracefully
fat. Do you know, Miss Wales, our
friend Jasper J. is going the pace all right, if
that cloud of dust ahead is his outfit.”</p>

<p>“We’re catching up a little though, aren’t
we?” asked Betty anxiously.</p>

<p>“We certainly are,” Dick assured her, “but
I’m afraid it’s no ten minute job we’ve tackled.
I didn’t know he was such a reckless driver.
I’m sorry I got you out here on false pretences,
Miss Wales. Will Mrs. Hildreth worry?”</p>

<p>“Not unless I’m awfully late,” said Betty
cheerfully. “And, anyway, we can’t help it
now. I certainly can’t walk back and you
can’t take me back; you’d surely lose Mr.
Morton if you did that.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Mr. Blake’s eyes were on the
white road ahead, and he spoke in jerky sentences,
keeping time to the throb of the machine.
“I should lose the trail, and the last
chance of making good on this assignment.
Time’s up to-morrow, you know. When I
met you I was blue as indigo&mdash;saw myself sailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
back to New York with my reputation for
being the best sleuth in town knocked to
splinters. So Mrs. Hildreth and Bob Enderby
will both have to bear up as best they can.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer how I’ve happened on Mr. Morton
twice just in time to accommodate you,”
laughed Betty.</p>

<p>“Mighty lucky for me,” said Richard
briefly. “You’re cold, Miss Wales. Reach
under the seat and you’ll find something in
the way of a wrap.”</p>

<p>Betty reached, and drew out a leather coat.
“How stunning!” she said, pulling it around
her shoulders. “Is it yours or Mr. Enderby’s?”</p>

<p>“It’s Bob’s.” He turned to look. “I say,
that’s a new one on me. Bob’s blossoming
out in awfully swell togs all of a sudden. He’s
been sporting an old corduroy coat that his
wife wouldn’t have in the studio.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blake, the other car has stopped!”
cried Betty eagerly.</p>

<p>“It has, for sure. You certainly do bring
luck, Miss Wales! Now here goes for one last
desperate spurt.”</p>

<p>They dashed along the straight white road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
in silence, Betty wondering rather anxiously
how Jasper J. Morton would receive them,
Mr. Blake intent on his work, until suddenly
he gave an impatient little exclamation, and
slowing down, leaned forward to listen to his
engine.</p>

<p>“The gasoline can’t be low,” he muttered
angrily. “I took her to be filled myself and
Bob just ran her around the town a bit afterward.”
He went slower still to make sure.
“It is low,” he told Betty dejectedly. “It’s
horribly low. We shall be lucky if we catch
him where he is now. If he starts on we’re lost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, perhaps he won’t start on,” said
Betty cheerfully, “at least not if we hurry.”</p>

<p>Dick started the car again. “I say, but
you’re game,” he declared admiringly. “A
good many girls would dislike the charming
prospect of having to go home in a Brittany
farm-wagon.” He squinted at the big car
ahead. “Jasper J. can’t take us back. He’s
punctured one of his back tires. He’ll be in
an angelic mood to receive us.”</p>

<p>Betty gave a nervous little laugh. “That’s
what I’m afraid of.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blake sighed. “I oughtn’t to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
brought you, Miss Wales&mdash;I don’t see how I
ever thought of such a foolish scheme. But
now that you’re here you’re just to sit in the
car, while I go and inquire the way to the
nearest gasoline supply, and incidentally, as I
inquire, discover that I’m talking to a man
I want most awfully to see. It’s all going to
be beautiful and casual, and I shall refer to
you only if everything else fails.”</p>

<p>By this time they were very near Mr. Morton’s
car, and their own was crawling so slowly
that Mr. Blake drew it up by the roadside and,
tooting his horn a few times by way of encouraging
Mr. Morton to wait for him, started
briskly off to his interview.</p>

<p>“You’ll be in plain sight of us,” he told
Betty, “so you can’t get lonely, and you can
have oceans of fun watching Jasper J. turn me
down&mdash;or try to.”</p>

<p>Betty, watching him go, wished she had
thought it fair to tell him about the railroad
presidents who were waiting at Dol. “But I
couldn’t do that,” she reflected. “I’m afraid
I’ve told him too much as it is.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was a good deal of excitement
at the Dinard Casino&mdash;the “high-life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Casino,” so read the tickets of admission and
the placard by the door. It wasn’t about
Betty; Mrs. Hildreth and the girls had been
wondering about her non-appearance, but they
had scarcely reached the worrying stage as yet.
The excitement had to do with a scandal in
“high-life.” A young Frenchman had driven
his car in from a near-by château, had barely
stepped inside the Casino, and come back to
find the car gone. He had immediately borrowed
a racing machine and rushed off in hot
pursuit, leaving the Casino piazzas agog with
strange rumors. These flew about chiefly in
French, but Madeline and Babbie caught
snatches and told the others. The most picturesque
detail was the fact that the Casino’s
porter had stood unsuspectingly and watched
the thief and his confederate, a pretty young
girl, drive off. The girl had come and stood
on the steps,&mdash;looking in, supposedly, to make
sure that the coast was clear. She was English
or perhaps American, was young, with
curly golden hair, was dressed all in white,
and had nothing of the air of the adventuress
about her. Madeline and Babbie exchanged
bewildered glances, suppressed some details,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
and covertly assured each other that Betty
was too old and too sensible to let herself be
kidnapped in broad daylight. And how otherwise
should she be helping to steal automobiles?
It was too ridiculous!</p>

<p>This was just what an excited young Frenchman,
having stopped his racing car with a skilful
turn close beside her, and caught her attention
by a low bow and a deferential “Pardon,
Madame,” was demanding of her in
rapid-fire French, which dazzled poor Betty’s
mind into absolute blankness.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t understand,” she
said sadly at last. “That is, Jé ne comprend
pas. If you can’t speak English, you’d better
ask Mr. Blake. Demandez à ce monsieur.”
She pointed ahead.</p>

<p>“Ah!” The Frenchman’s black eyes flashed
with pleasure as he noticed Mr. Blake. He
turned to a man in uniform in the tonneau
and they conversed in more rapid-fire French,
after which the man in uniform jumped out
of the Frenchman’s car and then with another
“Pardon, Madame,” calmly climbed into
Betty’s. This was strange enough, but the
effect of the Frenchman’s communication on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
Mr. Blake, who spoke French like a native,
was even stranger. He listened a minute,
asked a quick question, and then started on
the run toward Betty, with Jasper J. Morton
panting behind him. When Mr. Blake
started, the man in uniform hopped nimbly
out and stood in the middle of the road, as if
to intercept his passage, and when he rushed
around to the back of the car the man in uniform
was instantly beside him.</p>

<p>“It’s true, all right,” he told Betty a minute
later, coming around to her side. “Oh, you
didn’t understand? He says I’ve stolen a
car, and I have. That’s not Bob’s number.
This car is absolutely like his in every other
way&mdash;except for the lack of gasoline and the
different coat, of course. And how was I to
know that Bob hadn’t squandered his gasoline
and bought a new coat?”</p>

<p>“Miss B. A.! Are you here?” cried Mr.
Morton, coming up behind Dick. “Then perhaps
you’ll be good enough to explain. This
gentleman asked me to lend him gasoline
enough to get to a garage, and instead of waiting
for my answer he begins to jabber French
and then runs off like a madman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“Why, we’ve stolen a car,” explained Betty.
“That is, Mr. Blake took the wrong one by
mistake, and these people thought he did it on
purpose.”</p>

<p>“Took the wrong car by mistake,” muttered
Mr. Morton. “Well, I don’t doubt it, since
you vouch for the gentleman, but otherwise it
would look very black to me. Is he given to
making mistakes of that sort?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” cried Betty quickly. “But you
see we were in such a hurry, and I suppose he
was pretty much excited because it was his
last chance and so important and all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” commanded Mr. Morton
peremptorily. “I don’t follow you. What
was your tremendous hurry? What was
the gentleman’s last chance that it was
of the utmost importance he should utilize?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hadn’t he told you?” asked Betty.
“But of course he hadn’t had time to. Why&mdash;please
don’t be angry, Mr. Morton, but we
were chasing you. Mr. Blake’s newspaper
sent him over here to interview you, and he
has missed you ever so many times, and he
couldn’t stay any longer than to-day.” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
paused to see what the effect of her announcement
would be.</p>

<p>“You and a New York reporter chasing me
in a stolen automobile! A pretty story that
would make!” Jasper J. Morton’s tone was
deeply indignant. Then he looked from Betty’s
solemn face to Mr. Blake, who was hot
from his run and his valiant efforts to convince
the Dinard police sergeant of his innocence,
then at the Frenchman, alert and
smiling, as he awaited the outcome of the discussion,
and his eyes began to twinkle. “Does
he know about those railroad presidents in
Dol?” he demanded, jerking his thumb toward
Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>Betty explained that she hadn’t considered
herself at liberty to tell Mr. Blake that.</p>

<p>“Just chased me on general principles,” he
chuckled. “Well, I’ve been chased pretty
hard sometimes, but never by a pretty girl in
a stolen automobile, so far as I remember.
Hi there, young man,” he raised his voice.
“Come over here and tell me how all this
happened.” Then, as Dick deserted the sergeant,
he added, “Miss B. A. here is trying to
make me think that I’m to blame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Dick laughed. “Then I suppose she’s told
you that it was awfully important to me to see
you. If I could just ask you a few questions,
Mr. Morton, before I go back with this man,
I should be everlastingly obliged. He insists
on putting me under arrest. I’ve got a friend
in Dol who’ll go bail for me, but until then
the best I can do is to make him let Miss
Wales off.” He smiled dejectedly at Betty.</p>

<p>“Put you under arrest, indeed!” sniffed
Jasper J. Morton. “Why, it was a clear case
of mistake, wasn’t it? She says it was. You’ve
got a friend who’s got a car like that, haven’t
you? You can show ’em&mdash;the car and the
friend&mdash;as soon as we get into Dinard. You’ll
ride back with me, both of you, if my man
ever gets that puncture mended.” Jasper J.
Morton pulled out a roll of fifty-franc notes
and flourished them at the sergeant, who was
staring uncomprehendingly. “How much do
you want, my good fellow? I’ll go bail, or
whatever you please to call it. Ask him how
much he wants, Miss B. A. Where’s your dictionary?
No,” as Mr. Blake started forward,
“you wait a minute. She’ll manage him
best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>So Betty explained what Mr. Morton wanted,
with frequent promptings from that impatient
gentleman; and the sergeant, accepting a small
fee “for the accommodation,” agreed to take
the gentleman’s word and his friend’s word
that they would both appear in court at Dinard,
if, after the aggrieved Frenchman had
seen Mr. Bob’s car and interviewed its owner,
he was not willing to accept Mr. Blake’s apology
and withdraw his suit. As a matter of
fact, all the Frenchman wanted was his car
back unharmed; he had brought the police
sergeant only in case of emergency. And as
the policeman couldn’t drive a car, he was
glad to accept Mr. Morton’s offer that his chauffeur,
who had at last finished repairing the
tire, should put in enough gasoline from his
machine to carry the stalled car to a garage
and should then drive it back to Dinard.</p>

<p>“I’m going to drive mine myself,” Mr.
Morton announced. “That’s another thing
that my doctor told me not to do, you know.
Blake, get in behind with Miss B. A.”</p>

<p>But Betty protested that she was tired and
wanted the tonneau to herself. As a matter
of fact, she was sure that if Mr. Blake and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Morton rode together, Mr. Morton would never
be able to resist telling about the railroad presidents
cooped up in Dol waiting for him. And
sure enough, it was only a few minutes before
she heard him say, “That’ll make a great story,
you know. Sleepy French town&mdash;nothing
happened there for centuries&mdash;doesn’t know
the meaning of high finance. Americans
choose it as neutral ground on which to discuss
biggest traffic coup in history. Wall
Street feels the shock. Oh, I suppose you can
turn out that sort of thing much better than I
can. You come over to Dol and see the fun.
I’ll introduce you as my secretary. Can you
act a little like a secretary?”</p>

<p>After a while she heard him ask, “Do you
always chase everything you want as hard
as you chased me? I like to see a man chase
hard.”</p>

<p>Madeline and Babe were on the Casino
steps waiting to get the first possible sight of
the crowd coming up from the ferry, for if
Betty didn’t come on this boat they were all
going back to Saint Malo in the hope of finding
her there. But before Betty, assisted by Mr.
Blake and Mr. Morton, had finished explaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
herself, the Frenchman, who had waited
to pilot his own car to a garage, came up, and
Madeline deserted her friends to rush at him
with such a friendly greeting and such a torrent
of questions in French, that she immediately
became the centre of interest.</p>

<p>“Dick Blake,” she began, bringing the smiling
Frenchman over to the other group, “do
you mean to tell me that you’ve forgotten my
cousin Edmond, after all the fun we had together
in Paris? That’s as bad as Edmond’s
having forgotten his English, so that he
couldn’t tell Betty in plain terms that she was
a thief.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Madeline!” He turned to Betty,
eager to deny such an intention, but his face
fell and he made a comical gesture of inadequacy.
“It ez so far away! I cannot say my
meaning.”</p>

<p>“So long ago, you mean, don’t you, young
man?” asked Mr. Morton, eyeing him as if he
were some sort of strange animal. “See here,
these reunions are all very interesting, but I’m
getting hungry. Now, why can’t you all have
dinner with me at that hotel over there?
Baedeker says it’s the best in the place. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
sort of peace festival, you know. Miss B. A.,
suppose you take me in and present me to
Mrs. Hildreth and see what she says about
it.”</p>

<p>Babe had hurried in ahead of them with the
news of Betty’s safe return, without waiting
to have any conversation with Mr. Morton.
But when the dinner project was approved by
Mrs. Hildreth and Mr. Morton insisted that
“the little tomboy” must sit on his left, Babe
made no objection, and she had spirited repartees
ready for all Mr. Morton’s sallies. She
even went so far as to tell him about the Harvard-Cambridge
race and ask him, as she had
promised John she would, to take her to see it.</p>

<p>“Sure you won’t throw me over for a
younger beau?” he asked her. “He’s likely
to be in London then if I am, you know.”</p>

<p>But Babe only laughed unconcernedly, and
assured him that she never, never broke engagements.</p>

<p>The party separated early because, as Mr.
Morton explained jovially, he and Mr. Blake
had urgent business in Dol. Mr. Blake had
managed to sit beside Madeline at dinner,
and had told her all about his success with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Mr. Morton, and what he hoped might come
of it.</p>

<p>“I just must tell some one or I’ll burst,”
Blake confided. “Mr. Morton has been
asking me about the magazine. ‘If you had
a hundred thousand or so and a free hand,
could you win out with it?’ he asked me. So
who knows, Madeline&mdash;my chance may have
come at last!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick,” Madeline began, breathlessly,
“wouldn’t that be&mdash;&mdash; I’m going to touch
wood right away,” she added, suiting the
action to the word. Dick laughed, but his eyes
were shining with a new hope and purpose.</p>

<p>“He never mentioned Eleanor, of course,”
Madeline told the others, as they brushed
their hair in Babe’s room and discussed the
events of the most exciting day of the summer.
“But that’s why he cares so much. He used
to be the most indifferent, blasé person you
ever saw.”</p>

<p>“What I don’t understand,” said Babbie,
carefully barricading herself from a storm of
pillows, “is why a person who doesn’t want
to see another person as long as she lives
should invite another person’s father to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
her to a boat-race, knowing that another
person will be there too.”</p>

<p>“Your English is mixed,” retorted Babe
with all her customary levity, “but if you
mean me and Mr. Morton and the race in
London, why I promised to ask him ages
ago, and I wouldn’t back down now just
because John and I were silly and quarreled.
John was your friend to begin with, and if
he tags his father to the race you can look
after him, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t look after men; I let them look
after me,” announced Babbie with dignity.</p>

<p>“Don’t squabble,” said Madeline. “I’ve
got an idea. I believe Arthur Lestrange
Trevelyan, or Lestrange Arthur Trevelyan, is
all right. Think how black things looked
for Dick to-day, with only the thin excuse
of having made a mistake about the automobiles.
If Edmond had been a bad-tempered
person and the police sergeant had been incorruptible,
they’d certainly have arrested
him.”</p>

<p>“And Betty too,” put in Babbie. “Think
of poor innocent little Betty’s being arrested!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“He must be all right&mdash;Mr. Trevelyan,
I mean,” suggested Babe, “because as soon
as John got your letter, he and Mr. Benson
would have gone to work to find out about
him, and if he hadn’t been all right they’d
certainly have written to us before this.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to bed,” said Betty,
yawning vigorously. “I’m sleepy, and if
your cousin is going to take us automobiling
all day to-morrow and comes for us as early
as he said, we’ve got to be up betimes.”</p>

<p>“Too true,” agreed Madeline. “But please
don’t hold us responsible for the strenuous life
we’re leading. It’s all your fault, Miss B. A.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do a single thing I could help,”
protested Betty.</p>

<p>But Madeline insisted gaily that it had
all been a preconceived plan on Betty’s part
to make her dominant interest fill most
space in the annals of “B. A.’s Abroad.”</p>

<p>“You began with mild little benevolent
adventures,” she said, “and now you’ve had
what Roberta Lewis would call a near-adventure.
Next thing you know you’ll plunge
us all into a real adventure&mdash;the kind you
read about in novels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be great?” sighed Babe
sleepily. “Now please run away and let me
have a little peace.”</p>

<p>But Madeline and Babbie were still wide
awake. They sat on the edge of poor
Babe’s bed for an hour longer inventing
“real adventures” that should materialize in
Paris.</p>

<p>“The thing we need is an adventurer,”
complained Madeline sadly, “that is, unless
Mr. Trevelyan will ‘oblige with the part,’ as
they say at actors’ benefits. We’ll ask Edmond
about the haunts of adventurers. Perhaps
he’ll be able to put us on the track of
a king in exile looking for an American
wife, or a prime minister watching for a lady
to drop her handkerchief as a signal that she
is his fellow conspirator. You see I have to
leave you in Paris and I do want a grand excitement
of some sort before I go.”</p>

<p>“Paris gowns are quite exciting,” suggested
Babbie, dragging Madeline off to bed at last.
“I’m not counting on the ball, because it’s so
uncertain.”</p>

<p>“Why how stupid of us to have forgotten
the ball,” began Madeline eagerly. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
could start a perfectly magnificent adventure
with that.”</p>

<p>But Babbie put her fingers over her ears and
ran away. “It’s awfully late,” she explained,
“and besides, I shall want to go to the dance
more than ever if you make up a lovely story
about it. So good-night.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A REAL ADVENTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madeline’s</span> cousin Edmond, who was motoring
about Brittany with a friend, took the
girls to the quaint old shrine of Mount St.
Michel and promised them other expeditions
equally delightful if they would only stay on
for a few days longer at Saint Malo or Dinard.
But Mrs. Hildreth felt anxious to get to Paris,
which was really the goal of all her trips
abroad, and Babbie had her own reason&mdash;the
countess’s ball,&mdash;for not wanting their arrival
delayed beyond the appointed day.
Babe couldn’t have explained even to herself
why she wanted to be in Paris, but she did.
And Betty and Madeline, not wishing to be in
the opposition and being sure of a good time
either way, were perfectly satisfied with Mrs.
Hildreth’s decision to go on just as they had
intended.</p>

<p>“And we’ll go to Madeline’s pension, shan’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
we, mummie?” asked Babbie, a trifle anxious
lest Mrs. Hildreth should insist on the hotel
where she always stayed.</p>

<p>“And it’s just as ordinary and commonplace
as if it were in New York,” Babbie had told
the girls sadly, with a newly awakened perception
that her traveling had hitherto been
of a very commonplace variety. But Mrs.
Hildreth only asked what were the especial
merits of Madeline’s pension.</p>

<p>“She won’t tell,” explained Babbie, looking
beseechingly at Madeline, who only returned
a serene smile. “She just says it’s queer and
quaint and the kind of thing we all like, and
that we can see what it’s like, if we go there.”</p>

<p>“But if we don’t go there, you simply must
describe it, Madeline,” said Betty so solemnly
that Mrs. Hildreth laughed and declared they
would patronize Madeline’s pension.</p>

<p>Finally, after a long day’s ride in the Paris
express and a drive across the city in the queer
taximeter cabs&mdash;where you sit and watch the
distance and the francs for the fare, pile up in
the indicator and forget, in the absorbing interest
of this occupation, to look around you
at the sights of the strange city&mdash;the driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
of the first cab stopped before a blank wall in
a narrow, rather dirty street. Upon being
admonished by Babbie that he was wrong he
pointed inexorably at the number on the wall,
and even Babe, most ardent admirer of Madeline’s
theories, gave a gasp of dismay. The
two girls were with Mrs. Hildreth, while Betty
and Madeline were behind, and Marie was in
a third carriage with most of the baggage.</p>

<p>“Careful, Babe,” Mrs. Hildreth whispered.
“We don’t want to hurt Madeline’s feelings&mdash;nor
Mademoiselle’s.” For Madeline had
written ahead for rooms, and when the porter
opened the door in the high and dingy wall,
a pretty Frenchwoman was running across
the graveled courtyard inside, eager to greet
her guests.</p>

<p>“We’ll stay here to-night,” Mrs. Hildreth
decided hastily, “and then in the morning I
can easily make an excuse to change.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was certainly charming, if her
front door&mdash;or front gate&mdash;was not. Smiling
and chatting, she led the way across the court
to the old stone mansion and helped her two
little maids show the party up-stairs and settle
each one’s baggage in the room she chose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
Madeline, Babe and Betty had single rooms,
all looking out on still another court. This
one was shut in on three sides by ivy-covered
stone walls, and shaded by a great magnolia
tree; and enticing little green tables, like those
in the cafés at Saint Malo, stood about here and
there. The rooms themselves were long and
narrow&mdash;just like cells, Babe declared with a
shiver&mdash;and as soon as she was dressed she
went down into the courtyard to wait for dinner.
When the girls found her she was sitting
on the gravel scratching the back of a big turtle,
which, she joyously informed her friends, was
attraction number one of Madeline’s pension.</p>

<p>“Its name is Virginia&mdash;no, that’s not right.
What’s the French of Virginia? Virginie,
then. And it knows its name, only it won’t
answer unless it knows you. At least, that’s
what I understood Mademoiselle to say. I’m
scratching its back so beautifully that it ought
to follow me around like a dog hereafter.”</p>

<p>Attraction number two was a very good dinner,
and attraction number three was going to
bed by candle-light, which made the tiny
rooms seem more like cells than ever. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
Betty suggested that they were more like nuns’
cells than prisoners’, and Babe said she liked
the idea of being a nun&mdash;it was very much
like being a man-hater when you came to
think of it.</p>

<p>Attraction number four was the best of all;
it was having breakfast in the garden. Mademoiselle
had explained that they could have
“petite dejeuner,” which means coffee or
chocolate and crusty rolls, whenever they
liked, and they had all agreed to be ready at
half-past eight&mdash;which is really very early indeed
in Europe&mdash;so as to have a long day for
sightseeing. Betty got down first and was
going into the dining-room to wait for the
others, when a servant asked her to sit in the
garden instead, and before she knew what was
happening, her breakfast appeared on a tray.
Just then Babe pulled back her curtains and
stuck her head out of the window to see how
the garden looked so early; and giving a
shriek of delight, she rushed down to eat, too.
Mrs. Hildreth hadn’t been much impressed
by Virginie or the candles, but she was
as delighted as the girls with breakfast under
the magnolia tree, and she readily agreed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
wait a little before deserting Madeline’s pension.</p>

<p>The first thing that every one wanted to do
after breakfast was to call at the American Express
Office for mail. It had been accumulating
ever since they left London, so there was
plenty to go around&mdash;letters and papers from
home for all the party, and for Babbie a note
from Billy Benson.</p>

<p>“He got here last night, too,” she explained,
“and he’s still with Mr. Trevelyan, so evidently
it’s all right about the name. He
wants our address and says he’ll be around
to see us late this afternoon, and possibly Mr.
Trevelyan’s sister may come, too. He was telephoning
her while Billy wrote. Oh, dear, I
don’t believe mother’s going to want me to go
to the dance, after all. But I’ll answer this so
they’ll know where to find us.”</p>

<p>Initiating Betty and Babe into the delights
of Paris was an exciting task, and by the middle
of the afternoon they were all quite ready
to go home, put on their thinnest dresses, and
drink iced tea under the magnolia tree while
they waited for the advent of Billy and Mr.
Trevelyan. It was six o’clock, however, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the men arrived, hot, tired, and in Billy’s
case, somewhat out of temper.</p>

<p>“It’s an awfully out-of-the-way street,” he
complained. “Why, Trevelyan knows Paris
like a book, but he couldn’t find it. We’ve
walked and walked and asked and asked. We
were late starting in the first place, though,
because Trevelyan’s sister didn’t come.”</p>

<p>“It’s very odd,” Mr. Trevelyan put in.
“She was to have come to our hotel at three,
after doing some shopping with her friend.
It was perfectly understood, but we waited
till four and she did not come. I am sure
only some unavoidable accident has prevented
her joining us.”</p>

<p>“Surely your mother will let you go all
the same to-morrow?” Billy asked Babbie.</p>

<p>Babbie looked doubtful. “I don’t know.
Not that she would blame your sister, Mr.
Trevelyan; but she’s awfully particular about
chaperons and she isn’t strong enough to
chaperon me to dances and things herself.
She’s lying down now, but I’ll write you the
first thing in the morning. Will that be
soon enough to decide?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Billy gaily, “only we thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
&mdash;Trevelyan has errands to do in the morning,
but he suggested that we meet in the
early part of the afternoon for a little sight-seeing.
You could let us know then, you
see.”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t been to the Louvre yet,
we might have a look at that together,”
suggested Mr. Trevelyan gravely. “I understand
some of the finest galleries are to be
closed next week for repairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you warned us in time,”
said Madeline. “I’m always missing things
at the Louvre because they’re closed for repairs.
Where shall we meet and when?”</p>

<p>Mr. Trevelyan suggested two o’clock, at
the main entrance by the umbrella stand,
and then he rose to go. “I am worried
about my sister. If she has sent no word I
must wire,” he said.</p>

<p>Billy rose too. “I should never find my
way back alone,” he said. “I’m dumb as
an oyster over here. It’s great being with
some one who knows the ropes.”</p>

<p>The girls protested against their going so
soon, when they had expended so much time
and trouble in coming, but Mr. Trevelyan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
insisted that he must get back at once, and
Billy laughingly declared that the girls would
have to see him safely home if he stayed and
then he would have to see them safely back,
and so ad infinitum.</p>

<p>When Babbie consulted her mother about
the dance, Mrs. Hildreth listened to the story
of the boys’ call, and after a little consideration
decided that she couldn’t allow Babbie
to go.</p>

<p>“Billy is a dear boy,” she said, “and his
friend seems a thoroughly nice fellow, but
I couldn’t think of letting you go to a dance
with them out in some suburb of Paris, unless
I knew you were in charge of a sensible, careful
chaperon. Mr. Trevelyan’s sister may or
may not answer the description. We have
no idea how old she is, or what sort of person
she is, or whether she even understands from
her brother that you would be in her charge.
Evidently you wouldn’t be while you were
going and coming. Oh, it’s quite impossible.”</p>

<p>And Babbie admitted sadly that it was.
She brightened at once, however. “If I’m
as sleepy to-morrow night as I am to-night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
I shouldn’t enjoy it. After all, you can go
to plenty of dances at home, and you can’t
go to these fascinating galleries and museums
and churches. I should waste to-morrow and
perhaps the day after if I went to the dance.
Now I can go ahead and get as tired as I like
seeing things.”</p>

<p>So Babbie and Madeline conducted the
novices to Notre Dame, took them up in the
tower to get a near view of the gargoyles, and
then hunted up the shop on the Rue Bonaparte
where you can buy small plaster gargoyles,
exactly like those on the cathedral
for two francs and fifty centimes each. It
took so long to decide which Roberta would
prefer, and which was best suited to K.’s taste
and to Rachel’s, that the girls had to snatch
a hasty luncheon at an English tea-room near
the Louvre in order to be at the appointed
rendezvous by two o’clock. But they did get
there exactly at the appointed time, in spite
of a little dispute between Babbie and Madeline
about which was the “main entrance”
to the Louvre. However, Babbie was speedily
convinced that the main entrance was the
one that had been built for the main entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
&mdash;the one with the splendid façade and not
the one at the opposite side that happened to
be more conveniently situated and was consequently
most used by visitors. However,
when they had waited fifteen minutes and
the men had not appeared, the subject began
to be agitated again.</p>

<p>“Well, what does it matter?” demanded
Babbie, who hated to be kept waiting and was
consequently rather out of temper. “They
can reason the thing out just as well as we
can. If they’ve gone to the other entrance
and don’t find us there, they can come here.
It’s their place to find us, not ours to hunt for
them.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s silly to stick here, just the
same,” said Babe. “Why don’t Madeline and
I walk through to the other entrance and see
if they’re there?”</p>

<p>“Because they ought to do the walking,”
persisted Babbie. “They asked us to come
and meet them, and anyhow it’s always the
man’s place to do the hunting. I’m not going
to have you chase up Billy Benson to tell
him whether or not he’s going to take me to a
dance to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Whereupon Madeline murmured that it was
Babbie’s party, not hers, and Babe and Betty
declared they would wait until exactly quarter
to three and then they were going to see the
Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>And at quarter to three they went, Babbie
giving a reluctant consent to their making
a detour past the other possible rendezvous.
But Billy and Mr. Trevelyan were not there,
and when Madeline inquired of the very stolid
guard he only shrugged his shoulders and
said there had been any number of young men
passing in since two o’clock. Some had waited,
some not.</p>

<p>“Seems to me Mr. Trevelyan isn’t such a
good conductor as he has the reputation for being,”
said Betty. “Yesterday he didn’t meet
his sister, and nearly didn’t find us, and to-day
his arrangements haven’t worked out very
well.”</p>

<p>“Well, fortunately it doesn’t matter,” said
Babbie, sitting down with a rapturous little
sigh before the Mona Lisa. “The pictures
are here, and after we’ve seen a few we can go
and have some of those little boat-shaped strawberry
tarts that we saw in the patisserie window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
If they’d taken us somewhere to eat we
should probably have had to have stupid
ices.”</p>

<p>“And the moral, as our friend Mary would
say,” laughed Madeline, “is that when you’re
hunting alone you can do as you please, which
is an advantage that our friend Mary has forever
forfeited. Who votes to have the strawberry
tarts soon?”</p>

<p>“Maxim for travelers,” said Babe, dejectedly,
“‘when you’ve had enough, stop,’ and
enough is what you can see in just a little
more than half a day.”</p>

<p>So the girls had crossed the Seine on the
top of a lumbering tram, and walked from the
Luxembourg Gardens, where a concert was
going on, to the queer little street where Madeline’s
pension was hidden; and they had
cooled off, rested, and dressed for dinner before
a maid brought Babbie a card&mdash;Billy
Benson’s.</p>

<p>“Ask him into the garden and say I’ll be
there in a moment,” Babbie ordered, and went
down after a perfectly needless delay, by way
of preliminary discipline, prepared to receive
Billy’s excuses coldly and to give him a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
unhappy quarter of an hour in return for the
annoyance he had caused her earlier in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>But Billy made no excuses. Instead he announced
blandly, “Well, I’m two hundred
dollars poorer than I was last night and a
good deal wiser, and I feel like a young idiot;
but it certainly makes a good story, if that’s
any consolation.”</p>

<p>Babbie stared. “What do you mean? Why
aren’t you on your way to your dance?”</p>

<p>Billy grinned. “Dance is off&mdash;that is,
Trevelyan is dancing somewhere, I guess, but
all I get is a chance to pay the piper. You
see, it was this way&mdash;well, I’ll have to begin
with this morning.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” commanded Babbie, crossing to
Babe’s window and giving the B’s familiar
trill. “Come down, all three of you,” she
called, when Babe’s head appeared between
the curtains. “Mr. Benson has had a real
adventure, and we’re on the edge of it ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You’re the causes of the final catastrophe,”
accused Billy smilingly, as Babbie came back
to him. “If you’d made the proper connections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
with us this afternoon, Trevelyan couldn’t
have pulled off his grand dénouement. Where
were you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Right where we belonged,” said Babbie
firmly. “You begin with this morning, and
we’ll fill in our part when the time comes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">A NOISY PARISIAN GHOST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Makes</span> me feel like the greenest variety of
green freshman,” said Billy, when he had
shaken hands all around, “but still I do think
he managed awfully well, and that he’d have
taken in almost anybody with his smooth
stories. Of course I haven’t traveled much,
but still&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do go ahead and tell us about his taking
your money,” begged Babbie impatiently,
“and then we can discuss him to our hearts’
content.”</p>

<p>Billy nodded assent. “Well,” he began,
“you all know about our coming over to Paris
together. Naturally, as I can’t speak French,
Trevelyan chose the hotel&mdash;one he knew about
on the Rue de Rivoli&mdash;and our rooms opened
together.” Billy chuckled. “I thought of
that when I gave him the money. Made me
feel extra sure about getting it back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“Do go straight along,” commanded Babbie.
“If you don’t you’ll never get to the
robbery part.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t a robbery,” laughed Billy.
“It was something much smoother. I’ll get
to it in a minute. You know already about
our going sightseeing yesterday and then coming
here. Well, when we got home there was
a note from Trevelyan’s missing sister.” Billy
paused. “Come to think of it, I didn’t see that
note. But if I had, it might have been faked
just the same. Anyhow Trevelyan said there
was a note from his sister to say that the
countess was prostrated by the heat, and
they’d had to hurry home right after lunch.
That sounded perfectly reasonable. It was a
beastly hot day, and of course if the countess
was sick, somebody had to go home with her.
The sister said also that she was beginning to
be in a hurry to get into her own house, and
Trevelyan said that if I didn’t mind he
guessed we’d better do a little shopping this
morning. It seems that his sister had ordered
different things for the house put aside for his
approval, and he was to go to the shops and
look at them and have them sent out.” Billy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
paused reflectively. “Sounds reasonable
enough, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The girls nodded. “Do go on,” urged
Madeline.</p>

<p>“Well,” Billy took up the tale, “this
morning we started out in a taximeter cab.
First we went to two or three big stores and
Trevelyan looked at rugs and curtains and
one thing and another that his sister had
selected and ordered them sent out to their
house. At least he said so. My not speaking
French made me an easy mark for any tale
he wanted to tell me. Once or twice he
counted his money to see if he had enough to
do one more errand with before we went to
the bank. It was too early to go when we
started.”</p>

<p>“Did he actually pay for the curtains and
things?” asked Babe.</p>

<p>Billy hesitated. “I&mdash;well, I guess I didn’t
notice. Judging by the sequel I’m pretty
sure he didn’t. But he pretended that he
had, and finally he said we must go to the
bank next. I waited in the carriage. When
he came back he was awfully put out. It
seems there is a rule in this town that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
can’t draw money from a bank&mdash;from that
one where he had his account anyway&mdash;until
you’ve been here three days. Something to
do with the police regulations about foreign
visitors. His three days wouldn’t be up till
to-morrow, so he couldn’t draw any money.
He said he’d known the rule before but he’d
forgotten about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t his shopping wait a day?”
asked Babe.</p>

<p>“All but one item,” answered Billy
solemnly. “You see the ball to-night was to
be in honor of his sister’s birthday, and he
wanted to take her a birthday present.
She’d chosen that, too, at his request, and
we went to look at it. It was a beauty of
a pearl pendant. Trevelyan told the shop-keeper
how he was fixed, and ordered the
pendant kept for him until to-morrow.
Naturally I asked if I couldn’t accommodate
him with a little loan, so we could take the
pendant out with us to-night. But he thanked
me and said he couldn’t think of borrowing
of me, and we drove off. He was awfully
cut up about the pendant, though he kept
saying it didn’t matter at all, only, as he put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
it, ‘You know how women are about such
things. They like a present at the time. If
they’re going to have a birthday, they want
their gifts on the day. By the next day
they’ve forgotten all about it.’ But this time
it couldn’t be helped, he said, and it didn’t
really matter. And then he’d remark again
that he was afraid his sister would be awfully
disappointed, especially as he’d made a point
of her picking out the pendant and all. But
when I offered to lend him some money again,
he seemed almost hurt and refused quick as a
flash. Finally he changed the subject, said it
was a shame to make me waste a morning in
Paris over his private affairs, and asked me
where we should go sightseeing. It made me
feel awfully small to think how considerate
and unselfish he was, and I pulled out all the
money I had and fairly forced it into his
hands. He seemed pleased and thanked me
but said it wouldn’t be any use to him because
it wasn’t enough. The pendant cost fifty
pounds, and he needed forty to make up what
he had. So I thought how we were to be together
all the afternoon at the Louvre with
you girls and at the ball in the evening, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
then sleeping in adjoining rooms, and in the
morning he could get his money all right.
So I stuffed my beggarly thirty dollars into
my pocket, and told him to tell the man to
drive straight to the American Express, so I
could get two hundred dollars’ worth of checks
cashed.”</p>

<p>“And that time he didn’t object?” asked
Betty.</p>

<p>Billy shook his head. “Told me I was a
good fellow, wrung my hand till it ached, and
assured me that it was only a day’s loan or he
wouldn’t think of taking it. Then we got
the money, had a gay little lunch, and
stopped at our hotel on our way to meet you.
I didn’t go in. Trevelyan wanted to change
his coat for a lighter one, because it had
turned so hot. He stopped for the mail to be
distributed, so he was gone some minutes, and
we were ten minutes late in meeting you.”</p>

<p>“And then you went to the wrong place,”
said Babbie severely.</p>

<p>“You can’t blame me for that,” returned
Billy. “I asked right away if there could be
any mistake about the meeting-place and
Trevelyan said no. Later he explained that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
there was another principal entrance, though
he didn’t suppose any one would consider it
the main one, and he suggested that I wait
while he went to look for you at the other entrance
and in some of the galleries. He’d
been gone about five minutes when I remembered
my two hundred dollars, saw through
his little game, and started in hot pursuit.”</p>

<p>“And he got away?” demanded Madeline
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Without trying. You see, he’d packed up
his traps while he waited for the mail to be
distributed, and he had probably kept the cab
waiting to drive him back to our hotel whenever
he managed to shake me off. It’s almost
across from the Louvre and I didn’t see a cab,
so I ran. But when I got there he was gone,
bag and baggage&mdash;by a back way at that, so
the hotel has lost a little to keep me company.
It was a perfectly reliable hotel, you understand&mdash;one
of the first few in Baedeker.”</p>

<p>“And have you been to the police?”
asked Babe excitedly. “They ought to help
you catch him.”</p>

<p>Billy smiled delightedly. “Then you don’t
see the joke, either. The hotel people promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
to inform the police, and I went to see the
American consul. He put me on to the fact
that I haven’t a thing against Trevelyan. I
lent him the money voluntarily&mdash;pressed it
upon him, in fact. The police can’t help me.
I’ve ‘done’ myself.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully cheerful about it,” said
Madeline approvingly.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t at first,” laughed Billy, “but it’s
such a good story&mdash;or it would be if we knew
all the fine points, such as whether or not
there is a sister or a countess.”</p>

<p>“But he telephoned the sister,” suggested
Babe.</p>

<p>“May have telephoned thin air,” said Billy.
“It was in a booth, so no one knows what he
did.”</p>

<p>“But the countess sent the invitation,” put
in Betty.</p>

<p>“And I saw Trevelyan mail the answer,”
added Billy. “But he may have redirected
it on the sly to some of his confederates. He
must have at least one in Paris, I think, to
manage getting the mail back and forth.”</p>

<p>“Do you still think it’s all right about his
having two names?” asked Babbie. “Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
you depend on what he told you about that,
or did you make other inquiries?”</p>

<p>“About his having two names?” repeated
Billy questioningly.</p>

<p>“The two that Betty wrote John about,”
Babbie reminded him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking
about,” Billy persisted. When Betty
had explained, he assured her that John
never got her letter. “But Trevelyan
must have counted on your letting us
know,” he said. “Gee! but he had nerve to
keep on when he knew he was suspected. I
wonder&mdash;do you suppose that had anything to
do with his not finding you sooner yesterday?
My cab-man didn’t have the least trouble to-day,
I noticed.”</p>

<p>“And he sat near you while you were here.
I remember that,” contributed Babe. “But
how about the dance? What was his object in
planning that?”</p>

<p>Billy hesitated. “The consul gave me a
good fatherly talk, and he had a pretty gruesome
suggestion about that ball. He says
Fontainebleau&mdash;that’s where the countess lives,
you know&mdash;is on the edge of a great forest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
and that you could get a stranger out there
and drive him off somewhere and rob him
without half trying.” He turned to Babbie.
“Do you remember our guying him about
your money and your ring? Well, I think
that was undoubtedly his scheme. But when
you hung back and he knew that you had
probably heard Miss Wales’s story, why then
he cooked up a substitute. My checks wouldn’t
have been safe plunder, so there was no use in
holding me up.”</p>

<p>Babbie shivered. “I guess on the edge of a
real adventure is as near as I want to be. Think
of being driven into a forest and robbed!”</p>

<p>Billy looked very solemn, too. “Please
don’t think of it,” he advised her. “I’d have
given a lot more than two hundred dollars to
keep you out of a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Have you got your passage home?” asked
Betty, so seriously that every one burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“I have,” Billy assured her, “all nicely
paid for. And I shan’t send home for more
money, not if I have to pawn the beautiful
garments that I had made on Bond Street, expressly
for the countess’s ball. How Trevelyan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
must have enjoyed watching me order those
clothes! Well, he deserved to get some fun
out of it. Sight-seeing with me probably bored
him awfully, if he wasn’t as new to London as
he pretended to be, and all his clever little
contrivances must have kept him working
overtime. Lots of honest men earn two hundred
a month without taking half the
trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’m confirmed in my belief that he was
French,” declared Madeline. “He certainly
must have plenty of friends in Paris. He
probably was in hiding in Australia while
one of his bold, bad adventures was being forgotten
over here.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have been there some little
time,” said Billy, “for his stories certainly
had local color all right. But I don’t think
I should depend much on his advice if I were
John Morton. John and he got quite
chummy over the prospects for sheep-raising
out there. By the way, John ought to be
over here before long. Won’t it be fun springing
all this on him?”</p>

<p>“The best of it is,” said Madeline, “that
the more you think about it the nicer it gets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
It’s all so clever and finished&mdash;and&mdash;well,
typically adventurous, from the minute he inquired
of you about that London Club until
he vanished down the passage at the Louvre
this afternoon. It’s so interesting to wonder
what he thought and how he felt as he played
his cool little game.”</p>

<p>“Only it wasn’t a game,” Babe objected.
“It was business. Think of making friends
with people just so you can rob them afterward!
I always thought chewing gum was
about the silliest kind of a business, but I’d
rather have my father in chewing gum than
in adventures.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth came into the garden just
then and the girls pounced upon her with
their exciting story, making Billy stay to dinner
to help them tell it properly. At her
plate Betty found a letter which had been
sent direct to the pension instead of to the
express office.</p>

<p>“I wonder who knows I’m here,” she said,
tearing open the envelope, which was addressed
in a strange hand.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Probably an advertisement,” suggested
Madeline.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo5"><img src="images/i_284.jpg" width="400" alt="THE GIRLS POUNCED UPON HER"

<p class="caption">THE GIRLS POUNCED UPON HER</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>But it wasn’t. It was Betty’s letter to John
Morton, with “not found” written boldly
across the address.</p>

<p>Billy inspected it eagerly. “That’s not his
writing, but it’s his work. Nobody else could
have sent it here. So he did scheme to keep
us apart! That was why he took us to the
wrong station to see you off.”</p>

<p>“And why he kept you out so late the
night before,” put in Madeline. “We might
have tried to telephone you about the name
then. But I don’t see why he returned
Betty’s letter. He might just as well have
thrown it away.”</p>

<p>“Things you throw away leave tracks behind,”
said Billy wisely. “But more likely
he did it for the joke&mdash;timing it to get here
to-night and all. Following all his moves is
like going to a cobweb party. It will take us
weeks, and then we shall miss some of the
best points.”</p>

<p>As he was saying good-night Billy gave a
sudden exclamation. “I’ve got to go back to
London to-morrow to meet the crew, and I’d
forgotten all about it. Well, I guess I’ve
seen as much of some sides of Parisian life as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
most fellows could in three days, even if I
didn’t get further than the front entrance of
the Louvre.”</p>

<p>That night Babbie Hildreth slept lightly
and dreamed strange dreams. About midnight
she knocked the B’s knock on Babe’s
door.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sick, and I haven’t been
robbed,” she said, in answer to Babe’s plaintive
inquiries. “But there’s a ghost on my
side of the house, and all the rooms around
me are empty, so you couldn’t expect me to
stay there all by myself.”</p>

<p>“Ghosts are your specialty,” murmured
Babe, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not supposed to pursue our
specialties alone,” objected Babbie. “I
thought you’d be interested. Honestly it’s
the funniest thing,” she went on earnestly.
“Some one knocked on the gate, because he
was locked out, I suppose, softly at first and
then louder and louder. But now the gate
has been opened, and still the person stands
and knocks and knocks. It’s a man, I think.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s drunk and doesn’t know
enough to come in,” suggested Babe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>“No, he knocks as if he had a definite, sensible
reason,” said Babbie decisively. “Hark!
He’s actually pounding now. I hope Mademoiselle
will turn him out in the morning, that
is if he’s a boarder and not a ghost trying to
wake up the person that it has come back to
haunt.”</p>

<p>“Whatever he is, he’s stopped to rest,” said
Babe. “If he doesn’t begin again you’d be
willing to go back to bed, wouldn’t you? Or
I’ll go back and you can stay here.”</p>

<p>“Listen.” Babbie clutched Babe’s arm.
“There’s a noise on the stairs.”</p>

<p>There was, and presently it came nearer
down the hallway to the door. It was a queer
noise like a stealthy step with a dull thump
accenting it sharply now and then. Presently
it stopped, somewhere out in Babbie’s hallway,
there was the click of a key in a lock,
and then the steps began again, coming slowly
back through the hall and down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Does sound ghostly,” admitted Babe,
“and it doesn’t sound a bit drunk. And it
can’t be a boarder because it’s going out
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as it’s gone, I guess I dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
to go back,” said Babbie presently. “You
watch me down the hall, Babe.”</p>

<p>“Stay here, if you’d rather,” Babe offered
again, but Babbie insisted that she wasn’t
afraid and went off, her candle flickering in
the draughty passageway. The next thing
Babe knew the sunshine was sifting through
the branches of the magnolia tree and her
watch said half-past eight o’clock. So, forgetting
that it had been half an hour fast the
night before, she dressed in a tremendous
hurry and was astonished when she peeped
out from behind her curtains as usual to see
who was down, to find only a solitary gentleman
breakfasting in the farthest corner of the
garden.</p>

<p>“Why it looks like&mdash;it is John Morton,”
she said to herself. “Now what in the world
is he doing here, I should like to know?”
And she sat down on the edge of her bed in
a fashion that seemed to say, “If any one
thinks I’m going down to breakfast now, he’s
much mistaken.” But the very next minute
she jumped up again, surveyed herself anxiously
in the glass, and, without stopping to
get Madeline and Betty, as the first one to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
ready always did, marched down-stairs and
out into the court. Her start of surprise
when she came into sight of John would have
secured her a part in the senior play at Harding,
but John was so surprised himself that
any bungler could have taken him in.</p>

<p>“You here?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Babe, coolly. “Didn’t you
know it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Some friend of Dwight’s
gave us the address. It’s very near to the
big library where he’s got to bone.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Babe. Then there was a
long and dreadful pause. At last Babe broke
it. “I presume he won’t care to move.
Don’t let’s act like sillies. Let’s be perfectly
nice and friendly, so no one will know how
you&mdash;how we feel. For instance, if I go off
now into another corner of the garden every
one will want to laugh at us.”</p>

<p>“Do sit down here by all means,” said
John politely, springing to draw up a chair
for her.</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ve got to talk,” said John
doggedly at last. “How are the&mdash;what do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
you call them?&mdash;oh, yes, the dominant interests?
How are they coming on?”</p>

<p>“We had a ghost last night,” said Babe
primly. “It was trying to haunt some one
in the house apparently. It banged and
banged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why that was me,” said John with an
ungrammatical suddenness that broke the
ice. “You see Dwight and I got here about
eight and after we’d settled our traps we went
for a walk. Dwight got sleepy and came
back, but I tramped pretty nearly all over
Paris, I should say. And when I got here
at last, I happened to think that I didn’t
know the way to my room well enough to
risk finding it alone. So I called up the
porter. He thought I only wanted the gate
opened, and it seems he has it fixed so he
can do that without getting out of bed. But
I pounded and pounded until he decided I
was crazy, and came to put me out. And I
finally made him understand the fix I was
in.”</p>

<p>“You made the queerest noise coming up-stairs,”
said Babe. “It sounded too ghostly
for anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>“The porter has a wooden leg,” explained
John, “so he can’t go quietly. He made all
the noise that was made inside the house.
I’m very sorry I woke you all up and frightened
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we aren’t so nervous as all that,” Babe
assured him gaily, and was frightened to see
how friendly her words sounded. “Babbie,”
she called hastily, as Babbie appeared in the
doorway, “come and see the noisy Parisian
ghost and tell him about the ghostly disappearance
of his dear friend Mr. Trevelyan.”</p>

<p>Under cover of the story, Babe disappeared.</p>

<p>“You silly, silly thing,” she whispered, in
the seclusion of her nun’s cell, “you’re glad
to see him when you’re not sure he’s glad to
see you. Don’t try to deny it, because it’s
true. But don’t you dare to let him know
it. When he says he’s sorry he was so horrid
you can decide what to say, but not before.
I hope you’ve got pride enough to be a man-hater
as long as he is a woman-hater.”</p>

<p>Having relieved her mind to this extent,
Babe went to find Betty and told her about
John.</p>

<p>“I rely on you to stick by me,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
“The others will all try to leave us alone together,
and that’s just what I don’t want.
It’s queer how easy it is to tell you things,
Betty. I suppose that’s one reason why Mr.
Morton calls you Miss B. A.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Babe and Betty joined the others,
they found them still talking about Mr.
Trevelyan.</p>

<p>“Do you think now that he’s an authority
on sheep-raising in Australia?” inquired
Babe blandly of John.</p>

<p>John flushed a little. “No, I don’t believe
I care to use his letters of introduction.” He
produced a bulky packet. “His friends
would probably give me the same sort of send-off
that he gave Billy. I suppose Billy told
you that I’d consulted him about chances out
there,” John added, looking inquiringly
around the circle.</p>

<p>“But you weren’t serious about going, were
you?” demanded Madeline incredulously.</p>

<p>“I certainly was,” returned John in his
stiffest manner, and Babe’s little proud face
hardened. He wasn’t sorry that he had been
disagreeable; he was just giving up Australia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
because Mr. Trevelyan had proved unreliable.</p>

<p>After breakfast Mr. Dwight suggested that
they should all go and inspect the Pantheon,
which was so near by that the girls, thinking
they could go there “any time,” hadn’t yet
been to see it. As they started off across the
court Mr. Dwight happened to engage Betty’s
attention, and Madeline and Babbie marched
off arm in arm, leaving Babe and John together.</p>

<p>But&mdash;“Here, Babbie,” Babe called after her,
“you’re forgetting to take care of your property.
Ghosts are your dominant interest, and
John is a ghost. Therefore you ought to look
after him, Q. E. D.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to change interests with
me?” asked Babbie demurely. “You’ve been
going to get a new one all summer in place of
your inaccessible chimney-pots.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Babe coolly, “but I don’t
want a second-hand interest. If I change,
it will be for something that nobody else has
tried. Come on, Madeline.”</p>

<p>John accepted Babe’s prompt solution of
their difficulties, and in the rôle of “Babbie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
tame Parisian ghost”&mdash;it was Madeline’s
name, of course&mdash;coöperated with Babe and
Betty to avoid embarrassing tête-à-têtes.
Madeline and Babbie on the other hand, objected
strenuously to Betty’s enrolling herself
in Babe’s faction.</p>

<p>“I suppose she’s told you all about it,”
Babbie said dolefully, “and made you promise
to help her. She won’t tell me a thing, but I
can see for myself that in spite of her trying
to appear so gay and lively, she’s worried and
nervous and growing thin. Just because you
discovered that match-making won’t work
you needn’t try the other thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m only keeping her good natured,” explained
Betty laughingly. “She told me a
little, but she left out all the important points,
just as people in love always do. She doesn’t
know what she wants, and John doesn’t.
Something will turn up before long, I hope,
to help them decide.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will,” agreed Madeline easily,
“and meanwhile all Paris is before us. Where
shall we go to-day?”</p>

<p>“Let’s leave it to the man from Cook’s,”
suggested Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“Victor Hugo’s house, then,” announced
Madeline promptly. “John particularly
wants to go there.”</p>

<p>But John had promised to meet a college
friend that afternoon, and Mr. Dwight was
busy, so the four girls and Mrs. Hildreth
went off alone. When they got back John
was in the garden with a formidable collection
of railway guides and Baedekers piled on a
green table before him.</p>

<p>“Have to be in Antwerp to-morrow at ten,”
he explained impressively, and handed Mrs.
Hildreth a telegram.</p>

<p>“If you can really speak Dutch and French
decently,” it read, “meet me Antwerp, hotel
St. Antoine, ten Thursday morning. J. J.
Morton.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what he wants of me,”
John went on, trying to be perfectly matter
of fact, “and I’m dead sure that my Dutch
and French won’t suit him, but there’s nothing
like trying, so I shall go. See here, which
one of you told the governor that I could
speak Dutch and French?”</p>

<p>“I did,” Betty confessed, timidly. “I hope
you don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, not at all,” said John, who was
evidently trying not to appear obnoxiously
elated. “The thing I don’t understand is
why he believed you. You must have an awful
lot of influence with him to make him
think that I can do anything. Will you lend
me your precious French dictionary for the
trip?”</p>

<p>Betty promised and went off to find
the book, while the other girls said good-bye,
and wished John a successful journey.
The telegram, it seemed, had come before he
went out for the afternoon, and he had looked
up trains and packed, and was starting in a
few minutes more for the station.</p>

<p>When Babe got up-stairs, Betty was waiting
to waylay her. “I don’t see how I was so
stupid,” she said, “but my collar stuck into
me and it hurt so while I burrowed around in
my trunk tray for my dictionary, that I took
it off. Would you mind carrying this to John?
I’m afraid he’s in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Babe eyed her suspiciously. “I never knew
you to be so absent-minded,” she said.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to go back, I can ask
Madeline.” Betty started toward the door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
but Babe reached out a hand for the little
dictionary.</p>

<p>“I can go as well as not,” she said, and hurried
off.</p>

<p>“Say good-bye to him for me,” Betty called
after her, and after a discreet interval went off
to find Madeline and Babbie and tell them
what she had done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Babe had delivered the dictionary,
with explanations, and said good-bye
again.</p>

<p>“You’ll be back soon, of course?” she asked,
and in spite of all her efforts there was a little
quiver of eagerness in her voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t be sure.” John looked at her
hard and held out his hand. “I say, Babe,
let’s shake and be friends&mdash;real friends, not
friends for show, as we have been lately. I
was a goose about the Australian business.
Even if Trevelyan had been all right, it was
a wildcat scheme. I don’t know what my
father wants of me, but I’m hoping it’s help
with a business deal of some kind. That will
give me an opportunity to show him that I’m
not quite so no-account as he thinks, and
maybe he’ll give me a good chance next year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
if he won’t this. If I should make good with
him, will you reconsider?”</p>

<p>Babe put her small brown hand into John’s
big one. “I’d&mdash;well, I’d consider reconsidering,
I think,” she said slowly. “Remember,
I don’t promise anything but that, and&mdash;come
back as soon as you can. Good-bye.” Babe
dashed across the garden and up-stairs like a
whirlwind.</p>

<p>John was gone three days. The girls spent
most of the time in hunting a present for
Bob. “Some queer old thing that looks as if
it came from Europe” sounded easy enough
to find, and it was&mdash;too easy; so that each
girl had her own pet idea and couldn’t bear
to give it up. Finally, Madeline suggested
drawing lots.</p>

<p>“Each fix a piece of cake for Virginie. Put
the four in a row, and the one whose piece
Virginie gobbles up first can have the say
about the present.”</p>

<p>All but Babe were satisfied to save a bit of
the cake they had for luncheon. Babe, who
evidently understood Virginie’s tastes, went
out to a bakery near by and brought back a
beautiful little frosted cake with a cherry on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
top. And Virginie made straight for the
cherry.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle happened to come through
the garden just then, and Babe, who was beginning
to be as proud of her French as Betty
had been, rushed up to her triumphantly and
announced, “Nous avons mangé Virginie.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle looked horrified and amazed
until Babe pointed out the family pet and the
row of cake crumbs. “Avec gateaux,” she
added pleasantly.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle mildly suggested that they
had “given Virginie to eat of cake,” and Madeline
asked Babe how Virginie tasted.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Babe sturdily, when
she had seen her mistake. “I eat; I feed.
It’s exactly the same thing. I eat Virginie;
I feed Virginie. Well, that isn’t, is it? Anyhow
I know how to feed a turtle if I don’t
know how to talk about it. Now come and
buy Bob’s candlesticks.”</p>

<p>But while Madeline and Babbie were bargaining
with the shop-keeper for the pair of
candlesticks that Babe had chosen, Betty,
poking about in a dark corner, discovered a
queer thing that Madeline told her was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
Flemish lamp; and everybody liked it so
much better than the candlesticks that Babe
renounced the privilege of choosing and
joined the unanimous movement in favor of
the Flemish lamp. Then everybody wanted
one for herself, and the afternoon sped away
in the pursuit, for no antique store boasted
many of the lamps. There was a great difference
in the gracefulness of the tall standards
and the quaintness of the small hanging lamps,
and each girl insisted upon being exactly
suited before she made her choice.</p>

<p>“A perfect nuisance to pack,” laughed
Betty on the way home, “and absolutely useless.
I can just hear Will say it.”</p>

<p>“Not half so bad to pack as the flossy hats
you girls have been buying; they are warranted
not to break, and will make excellent
substitutes for hammers,” Madeline defended
their purchases. “Let’s take them into the
garden and see how they look all together.”</p>

<p>Arranged on two little tables, the five lamps
looked so imposing that Mrs. Hildreth had to
be called down to inspect them and admire
the “points” of each, as its fond owner
dilated upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the “show,” as Babbie
called it, John appeared. His greetings were
so subdued and formal that no one dared inquire
about his trip until Betty broke the ice
by asking if any one had mistaken him for a
Dutchman again.</p>

<p>“Not quite,” said John modestly. “I guess
you are the only ones who ever did that; but
my Dutch was all right and so was my
French. You should have seen my father
stare.”</p>

<p>After that it was easy to see that, as Madeline
put it, he was wearing the air of the
conquering hero, decently disguised. Mr.
Morton had sent boxes of hopje, which is a
delicious kind of Dutch candy that can be
bought nowhere but at the Hague, to Betty
and Babe, and they all sat in the garden eating
it while John told his story.</p>

<p>“Dad says he’s felt all right ever since the
day he disobeyed all his doctor’s orders at
once down in Saint Malo, so he’s kept on disobeying
them ever since. He had a big
business deal on at Antwerp&mdash;buying an
interest in a steamship line was the principal
part&mdash;and as he wanted to buy straight from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the men who owned the line he needed an
interpreter that he could trust. So he cabled
home, but the man he wanted was off on a
fishing trip and missed the boat.” John
chuckled. “I’m afraid he’ll pay pretty high
for those fish. Then, having implicit confidence
in Miss Wales’s judgment, he sent for
me.” He looked at Betty. “You’ve been
‘Miss B. A.,’ as dad calls you, to me this trip,
I can tell you. It’s been all my fault, I know,
the way my father has felt about me, and I
don’t blame him for not believing that I’ve
braced up. Now that he does believe it, you
can be sure I shan’t give him the faintest excuse
for changing his mind. He’s a brick,
when he gets started.” John stopped to
laugh at his absurdly mixed metaphor.</p>

<p>The girls drifted away with their precious
Flemish lamps, and this time Babe made no
pretence of not wishing to be the last to go.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve made good,” said John when
they two were alone, “and if my father insists
upon it I shall go back to college and do
my best to make good there, too. Will you
wait for me, Babe?”</p>

<p>Babe flushed and gasped. “I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
you’d talk about your trip awhile first. I
haven’t decided. It’s so much more serious
somehow, now that I’ve had time to think it
over longer. Let’s just be friends for awhile,
and I guess I can decide before very long.
Don’t ask me again till I say you may.”</p>

<p>It was now that Madeline’s pension developed
a new advantage. The garden was certainly
an ideal one for promoting a romance.
John was always down early for breakfast.
Mr. Dwight considerately came very late.
Betty and Madeline, when they were ready,
peeped surreptitiously out between the magnolia
branches, and if John hadn’t come or
was still alone they went down, ate hastily,
and found it absolutely necessary to go up-stairs
again at once. If Babe had joined him&mdash;of
course Babe never, never peeped nowadays&mdash;they
loitered in Babbie’s room until
the two in the garden had had ample time for a
leisurely tête-à-tête. Before and after dinner
the garden was the favorite loitering place, and
then again there were chances for judicious
management. But the days sped by, and still
Babe hesitated. One afternoon she had an inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>“Maxim for travelers: ‘When in doubt
drink afternoon tea.’ I’m certainly in doubt,
and we haven’t had a real tea-drinking for
ages.”</p>

<p>She was dressing for dinner, so she slipped
on a kimono and made a dash through the
hall to Madeline’s room.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to have a tea-drinking,”
she announced. “Can’t we, to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p>Madeline nodded. “It’s a queer coincidence
that I’ve just heard of the most fascinating
tea place. Also I had decided to make
you girls give me a going-away party there to-morrow.
I simply must be off for Sorrento.”</p>

<p>“Is it a real tea place?” Babe inquired
anxiously. “I insist upon tea this time&mdash;not
lemonade or ices.”</p>

<p>“Since when have you gotten so fond of
tea?” asked Madeline curiously. “In England
you always fussed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We haven’t had it so much lately,” explained
Babe, and departed in haste to finish
dressing.</p>

<p>“And I never told her I was sorry she was
going,” she reflected as she brushed her hair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
“Oh, dear, it’s dreadful to have something on
your mind!”</p>

<p>Madeline refused to give her hostesses much
idea of “the most fascinating tea place.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never been there,” she said, “but the
woman who sits next me at dinner said it was
awfully jolly. It’s out at Robinson, a little
suburban place. There are cafés in the trees,
and you climb up as high as you like among
the branches and enjoy the prospect and the
tea.”</p>

<p>“But mother could never climb up in a
tree,” protested Babbie.</p>

<p>“You don’t climb trees,” explained Madeline
placidly. “You climb stairs to little
landings built among the branches, just like
the ‘Swiss Family Robinson’ house. That’s
what gives the place its name.”</p>

<p>The Robinson party, which as a matter of
course included John and Mr. Dwight, started
out the next afternoon in high spirits. A
short train ride brought them to Robinson,
where they found a feature that Madeline’s informant
had not mentioned&mdash;sleepy little
donkeys waiting to carry them up the hill to
the tree-top cafés. To be sure Madeline and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
Mr. Dwight, in their eagerness to secure the
top story of the very tallest trees for the party,
abandoned their donkeys half-way up and
went ahead on foot, with the result that they
discovered it to be a very hot day, much more
suitable for lemonade than for tea.</p>

<p>“But we’re giving you a tea-drinking,” objected
Babe, when they were seated around
the table on the top platform, with the green
of the trees to shelter them from the western
sun and yet not hide the wonderful view of
Paris and the country between. “I shall
have tea anyway.”</p>

<p>“Have it iced,” suggested John, but Babe
shook her head.</p>

<p>“Regular tea,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“Then you can have lemonade to cool off
on later,” put in Betty. “You know somebody
has got to have a second course, so we
can have something to pull up in the basket.
The first time you order, the waiter comes up;
but the second time he puts the things in a
basket, and we pull. I speak to do the pulling.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we start this kind of tea-room
in New York, Madeline?” asked Babbie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
eagerly. “A three-story tea-room is even
nicer than a two-story tram. And the basket
is a beautiful feature. People would just
flock to see it work.” She pulled it up herself
by way of illustration.</p>

<p>“Be sure to have strawberry tarts on the
menu, and I’ll flock for one,” said Mr.
Dwight, helping himself to another of the
tarts in question.</p>

<p>“Things are more expensive in New York,”
Madeline warned him. “You won’t be able
to afford ten tarts, even if you are ravenously
hungry.”</p>

<p>“You could call it the Peter Pan Tea-Rooms,”
put in Betty. “It’s exactly like
the last scene in the play, except that there
aren’t any fairies.”</p>

<p>“You can’t ever be sure of that, you know,
Miss Wales,” Mr. Dwight took her up.</p>

<p>Babe listened absently to all the idle
chatter, drinking her hot tea conscientiously
and thinking hard. And because she was
serious and silent John was also, trying to
guess at her thoughts.</p>

<p>“The best way to tell whether you want
a thing is to think how you would feel to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
have to get along without it all your life.”
Babe came out of her brown study to hear
Madeline saying it. She gave a little start,
caught Betty’s eye fixed upon her as much
as to say, “Listen to that now,” and blushed
furiously; then she looked at John and
blushed hotter still.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you all talking
about?” she demanded. “I was thinking of
something else.”</p>

<p>“Babbie’s elegant new clothes,” explained
Madeline coolly, “and my philosophy of
clothes, which is not to bother with them.”</p>

<p>Babe jumped up. “I want to see the view
from the story below this, don’t you, John?
The trees are cut away more down there.”</p>

<p>John murmured something about being
rather tired of sitting still and followed her.</p>

<p>“Chaperon’s cue is to descend to lower
story,” laughed Mr. Dwight; but Mrs. Hildreth
decided that in this case the chaperon
would better stay where she was.</p>

<p>The two were back in five minutes, enthusiastic
over their view.</p>

<p>“I’m ready for my lemonade now,” announced
Babe gaily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to have another glass, too,”
added John. “You must all have another.
Babe and I want you to drink a toast.”</p>

<p>Which is how Madeline’s going-away party
was suddenly transformed into Babe’s announcement
party&mdash;not one bit fair, Madeline
said, but amusing enough to make up.
Anyway Babe always declared that Madeline
said what she did on purpose and that
Betty coughed to attract her attention to it.</p>

<p>“And I knew I didn’t want to do without
John all my life,” she said, “and making
up your mind is such a bother that I
wanted to have it all over with. Whenever
I’m in doubt again I shall drink afternoon
tea.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLING THE MAGNATE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> wasn’t a real announcement party, Babe
explained carefully.</p>

<p>“Only a private view,” suggested Madeline,
“which is not to be so much as mentioned
until Babe gives the word.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Babe, who had no serious doubts
of the continued approval of her family&mdash;she
had basked in it unquestioned ever since she
could remember&mdash;wrote a long letter home
and spent her last days in Paris in the garden
with John and Virginie.</p>

<p>“You ought to be making a specialty of a
trousseau,” Babbie told her severely. “May
be you’re not going to be married for a whole
year, but just the same there are lots of things
you can get here much better than at home.”</p>

<p>But Babe refused to be diverted to shopping
excursions. “I prefer fiancés for my dominant
interest,” she said. “They’re much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
wearing. Besides you’ve all given me such
lovely engagement presents. My trousseau
will have a Parisian touch from them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jasper J. Morton was automobiling
furiously through Germany. He wired Babe
to remind her of the boat-race and to invite her
whole party and John and Mr. Dwight to be
his guests; but he gave no address, so John
finally tore up the long letter he had written,
deciding to tell his news in person when he
and his father met in London.</p>

<p>A day or two after the going-away party
Madeline appeared at breakfast in her traveling
suit.</p>

<p>“My trunk has gone,” she announced, “and
my carry-all-and-more-too is strapped as
neatly as its bursting condition will permit.
And the man servant has gone to hunt me a
cab. Tell you sooner? If I had, you’d have
persuaded me to stay a day longer. Don’t
deny it, Betty Wales; I see it in your eye.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll be back in New York in time
to start the tea-room?” inquired Babbie
anxiously.</p>

<p>Madeline laughed. “If I don’t come, you
may have all the ideas, Babbie dear, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
promise not to open a rival establishment.
Father is thinking of a winter in Egypt, and
I’ve ‘stayed put’ at Harding so long that it
sounds very tempting indeed. But so does a
tea-room. I’ll write you when I decide.
Good-bye. No, I hate to have people come to
the train with me.”</p>

<p>And Madeline was off on her long journey,
blithely confident that each new experience
in life is amusing, if only you expect it to be
and waste no time in regretting such sad
necessities as missing a Harvard-Cambridge
race that you would give the world, if you
had it, to see.</p>

<p>The others crossed to London the day before
the great event. Billy Benson met them joyously
at the station.</p>

<p>“Sold my Bond Street clothes,” he announced,
“for just what they cost me, to a
nice little chap on the Harvard subs. Told
him he’d need ’em for the celebrations after
the race. Didn’t tell him that I was down to
my last little express check. How are you
people going to see the race?”</p>

<p>John explained, and Billy chuckled. “Bet
I’ve seen your father. He was down at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>American Express Offices this morning trying
to buy up the boat they’ve advertised as especially
for American spectators. Said he’d
pay whatever they liked if they’d refund the
money on the tickets they’d already sold and
let him have the whole thing for his party.
But they wouldn’t do it&mdash;couldn’t, of course.
He was in an awful rage.”</p>

<p>John and the girls laughed at the description,
and Mrs. Hildreth despatched John in
haste to his father’s hotel to explain that such
magnificent accommodations were quite unnecessary.
Jasper J. Morton was still peppery
over his defeat.</p>

<p>“Boats are all partly sold; desirable anchorages
all taken. Nothing to do but
scramble aboard with the rest of the crowd.
Maybe the girls don’t mind it; I do. When
I ask ladies to go to a boat-race, I want to do
the thing up properly.”</p>

<p>John decided that the time was not propitious
for making his announcement, but led
up to it gently by suggesting that dinner at
one of the big hotels on the Embankment
would be a luxurious enough ending to the
afternoon’s pleasures to make the girls forget
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>any slight discomfort they had experienced
earlier in the day.</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea,” Mr. Morton admitted
grudgingly. “Something in the
nature of a celebration of Harvard’s victory, I
suppose you mean. The London papers don’t
seem to think we’ll win, but of course they’re
prejudiced. I hope those Harvard fellows
haven’t come all this distance just to show the
English that Americans can’t row, eh?”</p>

<p>“Benson thinks they have a chance,” John
said, and repeated Billy’s lively account of
the crew’s practice records. “But if we don’t
win,” he added tentatively, “we can celebrate
something else.”</p>

<p>Jasper J. Morton sniffed scornfully. “The
Harvard spirit and a good race and all that?
No sir, a defeat is a defeat. If we lose, there’ll
be nothing whatever to celebrate. Don’t let
me hear you talking any nonsense of that
sort. A man who means to succeed in business
mustn’t get himself muddled about success
and failure. Be a good loser if you have
to; but don’t you ever boast about it, or celebrate
it.”</p>

<p>So John’s mild effort to introduce the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
of his engagement proved futile, and he
decided to wait till morning. But morning
found Mr. Morton spinning out to Windsor in
his car, because some one at his hotel had told
him that it would be madness to go back to
America without seeing the finest royal residence
in England.</p>

<p>“And when I got there this wasn’t a day
when it’s open to the public,” he explained to
Mrs. Hildreth on the wharf, with a stoicism
born of despair. “Well, if I live till to-morrow,
I shall be on my way to a country where
I’m glad to say that sightseeing isn’t the main
business of life. Where’s your crimson streamer,
Miss B. A.? You promised me a bow, didn’t
you?” He turned to Babe, who blushed so
red, as she pinned on the crimson rosette, that
if he hadn’t been watching so impatiently for
the boat, he would have guessed her happy
secret and saved John an anxious afternoon.</p>

<p>“For if we lose,” John confided solemnly to
Babe, “my father will be in a horrible temper
this evening. And if I wait and tell him on
shipboard, he won’t like my doing that. And
if he’s huffy about it to begin with, he’ll never
really like it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>
<p>Betty was standing apart from the others,
talking to Mr. Morton, who forgot to look at
his watch and mutter that they should be late
for the race after all their trouble, as he
watched her bright face and listened to the
story she was telling.</p>

<p>“Wish she’d break the news to him,” said
John, gloomily.</p>

<p>“I do, too. I’ll ask her,” volunteered Babe;
and as their boat touched the wharf just then,
and the rush for good places tossed them together,
she did.</p>

<p>But Betty only laughed at her. “Babe,
dear, you’re absurd. Run right up to him,
the two of you, and have it over. He’ll be
awfully pleased. But there’d be no sense at
all in my telling him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there would be, too,” protested John,
who had come up behind them. “I’m sorry
for you, Miss Wales, but it’s your destiny.
You shouldn’t have such a magic influence on
my father’s feelings if you don’t want to exert
it. Having benevolent adventures for your
special line, you’ve got to live up to the responsibilities
involved.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t choose that for my specialty,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>Betty persisted. “The girls just gave it to
me.”</p>

<p>“It’s just like a ‘Merry Heart’ election,”
declared Babe solemnly. “If Harvard loses
this race, you are elected to tell. There’s no
getting out of an election, you know.”</p>

<p>Babe wriggled in between two portly Englishmen,
pounced upon a desirable group
of chairs, sat down in one, and smoothed out
her huge crimson bow with the air of happy
irresponsibility that had won her her sobriquet
at Harding.</p>

<p>With Mr. Morton between her and Babe,
and John at the other end of the group, there
was nothing for Betty to do but wait patiently
for another chance to remonstrate with “those
silly children.” For she quite agreed with
them that it would be very foolish indeed to
delay telling Mr. Morton any longer. He
would naturally feel hurt to think that John
had let his friends and Babe’s into the secret,
but had kept his father outside the charmed
circle of intimates. It would put them back
upon the old footing of distrust and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It seemed as if everybody in London was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
in a boat on the river that afternoon, or hanging
over one of the bridges, or waving energetically
from one of the banks. All along
the course these were black with people, and
beside them, crowded boats fairly jostled one
another at anchor. “The Siren” steamed
up almost to the finish line before she came
to her allotted station, and John explained, on
Billy Benson’s authority, that even if they
couldn’t see the actual finish, they could be
practically certain that whoever had the lead
here would win the race.</p>

<p>“It’s simply got to be Harvard,” said Babbie
vigorously, and then suddenly noticing
that outside of their own party everybody on
board was wearing the English colors, she
laughed. “I suppose we ought to be willing
to be disappointed, because there aren’t so
many of us&mdash;only a few hundreds in all these
millions of English people.”</p>

<p>“If the Harvard crew has come all this
way only to lose,” began Mr. Morton testily,
and then looked at Betty and laughed.
“That’s just like me, isn’t it, Miss B. A.? Always
looking on the dark side of things, eh?
Always ranting about things going wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>Betty laughed and her eyes danced mischievously
as she looked from Babe to John.
“Never mind the race,” she began impulsively.
If she told, she certainly had a right to choose
her own time. “We’ve got something to tell
you that will make you forget there is a race.
Whether or not the Harvard crew wins, the
Harvard man you are most interested in has
won the biggest kind of a race&mdash;no, not a race
exactly,”&mdash;Betty stumbled over her metaphors,&mdash;“but,
well, the thing he wanted.”</p>

<p>“The Harvard man I’m most interested in,”
repeated Mr. Morton blankly. “That’s John.
What’s he won?”</p>

<p>“This is an awfully public place,” Betty
murmured. “Lean over and I’ll whisper it.”</p>

<p>There was a breathless moment while Jasper
J. Morton blinked hard, then looked at
John for confirmation of the news, and having
received a friendly little nod in answer,
turned to Babe with a smile on his grim face.</p>

<p>“Well, I can certainly congratulate John,”
he said, “and from the reports I’ve had lately
I can congratulate myself on John’s having
got hold of just the right person to manage
him and keep him up to the mark, so if you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
satisfied I guess it’s all right. And I hope
you’ll never regret it.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” said Babe blithely.</p>

<p>“And you don’t mind waiting a whole
year?”</p>

<p>Babe shook her head smilingly. “It takes
a long while to get ready to be married, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Because,” Mr. Morton went on, “there’s a
very good place in my business waiting for a
young man that knows how to talk ten different
languages, more or less. If he wants it
this September, he can have it. If he isn’t
ready then, why I guess we’ll have to keep
the place for him. Fellows that can talk ten
languages don’t grow on every bush.”</p>

<p>John and Babbie had moved their chairs so
that the party now sat in a close, confidential
circle of its own.</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully, father,” John began, “but
we’ve talked it over, Babe and I, and we’ve
decided that I ought to go back. If I leave
college now, I’ve been flunked out. I’d rather
not have that kind of record behind me.”</p>

<p>Jasper J. Morton nodded. “That would be
my idea, but I’d leave almost any kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
record behind me, I guess, sooner than disappoint
this young lady.”</p>

<p>Far down the river there rose the faint
sound of cheering.</p>

<p>“They’re coming!” cried an excitable
English gentleman with a white umbrella.
He lowered the umbrella and poked Mr. Morton’s
shoulder with it vigorously. “You’d
better stand on your chairs. It’s the only way
to see.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the roar of applause&mdash;a
great wave of sound that caught Betty
and tossed her up on her chair and fairly took
her breath away as she saw one&mdash;two black
specks come into sight around a curve and
dash forward, until, before she knew it, they
were alongside.</p>

<p>But just before that something had happened
in the second boat&mdash;the American boat,
alas! The third man had caught a crab.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! They’re down and out now,”
shouted the excitable Englishman.</p>

<p>“It’s Benson,” cried John.</p>

<p class="p2b">“He’s all crumpled up in a heap,” cried
Babe in anguished tones. “Oh, he mustn’t
give out now!”</p>

<p class="caption">SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED IN THE SECOND BOAT</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>Babbie Hildreth caught at the Englishman’s
white umbrella for support&mdash;it happened to
be the nearest thing she could reach&mdash;and
leaning far forward waved her crimson streamer
wildly.</p>

<p>“Billy! Billy Benson! Row for Harvard!”
she cried in a shrill, strained voice.</p>

<p>“Benson! Harvard!” John and Mr.
Dwight took up her cry.</p>

<p>The little Harvard coxswain who was pouring
water on Billy’s white face turned his
head at the cry, and Billy raised his inquiringly
and then calmly slipped back into his
place and caught his oar.</p>

<p>“Go it, fellows!” he panted, and the crew
took up its stroke.</p>

<p>The whole thing had taken scarcely an instant,
but the English boat was three lengths
ahead.</p>

<p>“Go it, Harvard!” cried the party on “The
Siren.”</p>

<p>And how they went! Nothing like that
spurt was ever known on the Thames before
or since. The English were bound to win,
but the crowd on the banks and in the boats
forgot that as they cheered the plucky Harvard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
crew, whose superhuman effort was
bringing their boat in barely a length behind
the Cambridge craft.</p>

<p>As they passed the finish line Billy’s oar
dropped from his limp hand and he fainted
quietly into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em I ended game,” he murmured to
the little coxswain as he went off, and the coxswain
himself came round in the evening to
deliver the message and to assure Miss Babbie
Hildreth that she had saved the honor of the
college and that Billy would be on hand next
day to thank her in person for keeping him
from the “fluke” that every athlete dreads.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it lucky we came?” said Betty
Wales, climbing carefully down from her
chair, while “The Siren” whistled madly and
the crowd cheered for Cambridge’s victory,
with a shout so deafening that it made all the
noise which had come before seem like child’s
play.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t they have begun to pull a
little sooner?” demanded Jasper J. Morton
grimly. But the next minute he had
caught the Englishman’s hand and was shaking
it cordially. “Glad you’ve won, I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
sure,” he declared. “You ought to win on
your own river. I’m glad our fellows gave
yours a good race.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to John. “Let’s cheer for
Cambridge,&mdash;a real American tiger.”</p>

<p>So John jumped on his chair again and led
the cheer, and the English passengers responded
for Harvard.</p>

<p>“There, Miss B. A.,” Mr. Morton turned to
Betty, “is that your idea of looking on the
bright side of things? All the same, John,
I’m disgusted with that crew. Don’t tell your
friend Benson, because he’s probably upset
enough as it is, but I’m sure I can’t see what
those boys came over here for if they couldn’t
win their race.”</p>

<p>“If they hadn’t come they couldn’t possibly
have won it,” Babe reminded him gravely,
whereupon Mr. Morton glared at her and
then, remembering that the race was not the
main feature of the day after all, laughed
good naturedly and told such comical stories
of his motoring experiences in Germany and
Holland that the defeated Americans were
quite the merriest party on board during “The
Siren’s” homeward trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>The dinner, which was a celebration in spite
of the race, was served on a little balcony
overlooking the river, gay with lights and
noisy with belated merrymakers. Then Mr.
Morton announced that he had a box at one
of the theatres, where moving pictures of the
afternoon’s race were to be the feature of the
program.</p>

<p>“Well, it was a good race,” he admitted,
after he had seen the pictures. “They got
ahead several times and they rowed well even
when they had to take the other crew’s water,
and that last spurt was all right, only it came
too late. I hope Benson understands that we
aren’t at all ashamed of our crew, John. You
might mention it when you see him.”</p>

<p>It is to be feared that Billy cared very little
for Jasper J. Morton’s opinion of him.
He had come out of his faint in a state of unwonted
and pathetic melancholy, only to find
himself, to his amazement and almost to his
disgust, the hero of the occasion. For awhile
he argued manfully against such an idiotic
idea, but finally he submitted to the popular
notion that his “crab” had made no difference
in the final result and that it had actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
proved an advantage because it had inspired
that wonderful spurt that was the talk
of all London and probably of all New York.
And since Babbie Hildreth was responsible
for this turn of events (and for some other
reasons) Billy resolved to cast enforced economy
and doctor’s orders to the winds and beg
or borrow enough money to give her “the
time of her life” during his last day in London.</p>

<p>As for Betty Wales, her eyes sparkled with
happy excitement as she went to bed that
night. A regular trip abroad would have
been fun enough, but a trip with Madeline to
hunt up the queer things, Babe to furnish a
romance, and Mr. Morton to play the good
angel and then pretend it was all her doing&mdash;so
that Dick Blake and now Babe and John
had insisted upon thanking her extravagantly&mdash;that
was a trip to make you hold your
breath and wonder how you happened to be
such a lucky, lucky girl. Betty’s last few letters
from home had been rather short and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I ought to have kept house for
mother this summer and let her rest,” she reflected.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
“And perhaps father couldn’t easily
afford to let me come. But I haven’t spent
nearly all the money he gave me, and I’ll
make mother take the grandest rest she ever
had as soon as I get home. And I can’t help
being glad I’m here.”</p>

<span class="smaller">HOME AGAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> busy days in London, and it was all
over but the voyage home. Billy and the
crew and John and Mr. Morton had left by
different routes the evening after the race, so
only Mr. Dwight was on hand to wave the
girls off at their boat-train. They were all
tired from trying to see too much and shop
too hard just at the last, and Babe was of
course forlorn with only a long steamer letter
to console her for John’s absence. So nobody
minded lying about on deck for the first day
or two, and after that a real storm added a
sad chapter to the girls’ seagoing experiences,
keeping all but the dauntless Babbie close in
their berths for the rest of the voyage.</p>

<p>On the last morning Babbie and Marie got
all their charges upon deck, where they lay,
rather pale and listless from their long confinement,
enjoying the air and the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>“Mummie dear,” began Babbie gaily, “do
you know what I think? I think that, if you
want to keep your reputation as a chaperon,
you’d better spruce up your young charges
before you return them to their adoring
families.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hildreth smiled faintly. “I have a
chance, haven’t I, since Babe’s mother and
Betty’s father have both had to give up meeting
the boat, and John and his father are in
Boston. How shall I do it, daughter? What
is the most effective method of sprucing up
storm-tossed collegians?”</p>

<p>“Send them to Harding to recuperate for a
day or two,” answered Babbie with suspicious
promptness. “The freshman rains will be
just over and Mary’s house will be settled, and
it will be simply scrumptious seeing her and
Georgia Ames and everybody, won’t it, girls?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” agreed Babe. “We could wire
Roberta to meet us there, and give her her
gargoyle and Mary her Flemish lamp. That
would be a great saving of expressage.”</p>

<p>“And we could display Babe, the tamed and
affianced man-hater,” laughed Betty. “Only&mdash;I’m
in a dreadful hurry to get home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>“What’s a day?” demanded Babbie. “We
can run up this afternoon. Bob’s going to be
at the boat, and we’ll drag her along as a
beautiful impromptu feature. Honestly, I
don’t think you girls ought to start on a long
journey west without getting rested a little;
it would make you horribly land-sick.
Wouldn’t it, mother?”</p>

<p>“It might,” admitted Mrs. Hildreth, smilingly.
“But seriously, girls, I meant to treat
you all to a side-trip to one of Babbie’s adored
villages, and we stayed on in Paris so long
that I lost my opportunity. So if you’d like
to substitute Harding, I want you all to go
as Babbie’s guests.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say that I hadn’t any
money,” Babe explained smilingly. “I shall
have just exactly a quarter left after I’ve paid
my steamer fees. But when the mail comes I
shall have enough for my ticket home, because
I told father to send it. And I thought
possibly that knowing me he might put in
something extra,” she added hopefully.</p>

<p>“You could have borrowed of me,” Betty
told her proudly. “I’m so pleased to think
that I can give father back my whole ‘emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
fund,’ as he called the extra that he gave
me to have in case I needed it. Nan always
spends her emergency fund; she says it attracts
emergencies instead of keeping them
away. But I didn’t quite know whether you
could honestly call a trip to Harding an
emergency or not.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to,” put in Babbie summarily.
“You’re to call it an adorable little
out-of-the-way village. Now who packed the
gargoyles for Bob and Roberta, and where is
Mary’s lamp? You two be thinking while I
find the purser and borrow a time-table of
Harding trains.”</p>

<p>So it happened that the three travelers,
reinforced by Bob Parker and Georgia Ames,
dined sumptuously at Cuyler’s and invaded
the Hinsdale mansion in time to catch Mary,
enveloped in a big gingham apron, washing
dishes.</p>

<p>“The cook took French leave this afternoon,”
she explained cheerfully, when the
noisy greetings were over, “and we couldn’t
have much of anything for dinner because
she took my cook-book with her, the wretch!
I’ve sent my husband off to buy another, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
I can find out about boiling the eggs for
breakfast. You wipe, Betty; and Bob, you
and Babe go down cellar and find some drift-wood
for the library fire. It’s piled up near
the furnace. Georgia, you can be putting
away the dishes.”</p>

<p>“The same old Mary!” laughed Bob.
“Does your husband enjoy being ordered
around?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mary sweetly. “He
considers it a privilege just as you always
did, Bob. Be sure you bring up plenty of
wood.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Mary divested herself
of her apron, unpinned her train, and explaining
sorrowfully that if she sat on the floor it
always attracted faculty callers, established
herself in a carved oak chair and ordered her
guests to “fire away.”</p>

<p>“Well, to begin with, Babe’s engaged,” announced
Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean thing!” cried Babe. “I
wanted to tell that myself.”</p>

<p>“No, you ought to have let Betty,” declared
Babbie with decision, “as her reward
for telling Mr. Morton, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Babe. “You tell the
rest, Betty.”</p>

<p>“Somebody tell it quick,” begged Mary
plaintively. “I’m dying of curiosity.”</p>

<p>So Betty “told quick,” and Bob aroused
Babe’s wrath by reminding her how it had
all been prophesied just after Mary’s wedding.</p>

<p>“As if that had anything to do with it,”
Babe sniffed. “Besides, we’re not going to
be married for a year. You may all be married
before that&mdash;Helen Chase Adams may be.”</p>

<p>Then Mary suddenly discovered that the
girls had some trunks with them, and she
insisted upon seeing their foreign trophies
immediately. So Bob pulled the drift-wood
fire to pieces and the other girls locked doors
and hunted Mary’s wraps, while Mary scribbled
a note of explanation to her husband.</p>

<p>“I’ve said we’d be back here for supper,”
she told them. “Roberta ought to come at
nine-thirty and she’s sure to be hungry for
gingersnaps.”</p>

<p>On the way they met and annexed Lucile
Merrifield and Polly Eastman, who invited
them to sit with the seniors in chapel next
morning, offered them their choice between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
dinner at Cuyler’s or the Belden, whose
matron, they declared, would be “pleased as
punch” to have such distinguished guests,
and reproached Mary hotly for not being
willing to conspire against the ten o’clock
rule by inviting them to join her supper
party.</p>

<p>“And the moral of that,” said Mary
sadly, “is that only sedate persons with no
wicked little friends in college ought to
marry Harding professors. I hope you’ll remember
that before it’s too late, children,
and not fall in love with one. And I hereby
invite Lucile, Polly and Georgia to dinner the
very first night I have a cook.”</p>

<p>It was great fun going through the trunks,
but it took a long time, because Mary was
constantly being reminded of desert island
experiences, which in turn suggested fresh-air
child anecdotes to Bob, and they got back to
Europe again only to be switched off on to
Harding news by Lucile or Georgia. But by
running most of the way they managed to
meet Roberta’s train,&mdash;which is Harding
style, because one never has time there to
waste on an early start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>And after supper, which was also Harding
style, the stay-at-homes promised to be quiet
and give the travelers a chance to tell their
adventures, and Dr. Hinsdale considerately
retired to his study so that the talk also
might be strictly Harding style.</p>

<p>When she had listened breathlessly to the
details of the “real adventure,” and to
snatches of all the others, Mary smiled her
“beamish smile” around the circle. “Well,”
she said, “you’ve all lived up to your Harding
reputations, as far as I can see&mdash;Babbie the
Butterfly, Madeline the Bohemian, Betty a
Benevolent Adventurer.”</p>

<p>“And the moral of that is,” put in Babbie
quickly, “what you are at home, that you will
be abroad.”</p>

<p>“Unless you drop all your individuality
and become a Tourist, with a capital T,” added
Roberta.</p>

<p>“Or change your spots and turn from a
man-hater into a fiancée,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s not changing your spots,” declared
Mary wisely. “It’s just making up your
mind, isn’t it, Babe?”</p>

<p>“How in the world did you know that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
Mary Brooks?” demanded Babe in such awe-struck
tones that her friends shrieked with
laughter, and Dr. Hinsdale came out from his
study to ask about the joke.</p>

<p>The girls had intended to leave early the
next afternoon, but when Georgia Ames appeared,
hovering in the Belden House hall,
before dinner was over, and announced that
she was giving a gargoyle party for them that
evening, why of course there was nothing to do
but insist that the gargoyle party should be a
“small and early,” and rush to the station to
countermand orders for carriages, and find out
about making connections with sleepers at the
junction.</p>

<p>“For we’re not so young as we were once,”
said Roberta, hugging Betty. “We don’t have
to be met at Harding by the registrar, and we
may travel at night if we like, as long as two
go one way and three the other.”</p>

<p>The gargoyle party was as mysterious as
Mary Brooks’s historic hair-raising had been.
Mary almost wept when Georgia asked her,
and she was obliged to decline because of a
previous dinner engagement&mdash;not to mention
the dignity of her position. She solaced herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
by making an elaborate costume for Eugenia
Ford, a pretty little freshman who,
when Georgia asked her to the party, thanked
her gravely and explained that if gargoyles
had anything to do with gargles she wouldn’t
come, because she never could manage to do it&mdash;her
throat must be queer. Most of the
other guests professed hapless ignorance of
what a gargoyle might be, but Georgia referred
them easily to Bob’s cherished imp,
which she had borrowed for the occasion, together
with some post-cards of other grotesque
figures.</p>

<p>“Just run in any time this afternoon, and
look them over,” she urged, “and come in costume
to-night, if you can. If not, it doesn’t
matter. Mrs. Hinsdale is going to offer a
prize for the best one, though.”</p>

<p>So the chosen few cast English Lit. papers
and a possible&mdash;nay, probable&mdash;written review
in Psych. to the winds, journeyed down-town
to buy masks and draperies, and preëmpted all
the desirable perches in Georgia’s room, marking
them with big “Engaged” signs, which
came loose when the wind blew in next time
the door was opened, and gave the room a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
disconcerting air of having been snowed under,
when Georgia got back to it just before
tea.</p>

<p>“But we had to do it,” Eugenia Ford explained,
as she helped Georgia put things to
rights for the evening, “because the whole
point of a gargoyle is that it stands somewhere.
Lucile Merrifield said so. And the
way you put on your costume makes a difference
about where you are to sit. No, the
other way around.”</p>

<p>“Conversely, you mean, my child,”
amended Georgia, pleasantly, putting Mary’s
five-pound box of Huyler’s on the chiffonier.</p>

<p>“But that’s got to be cleared off,” objected
Eugenia. “That’s Miss Bob Parker’s place.
We all wanted it, but she got it tagged first.
Belden House Annie promised her a step-ladder
to climb up by, but she said a chair would
do.”</p>

<p>Georgia sighed and dumped the ornaments
of the dresser top, cover and all, into her upper
drawer. “A gargoyle party is a thing
that grows on your hands,” she said sadly.
“Let’s go and eat. If there’s anything else
to clear off, we’ll do it later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>When the gargoyle party opened it was certain
that, whether or not it had grown on
Georgia’s hands, it was every bit her room could
hold. Betty and Babbie, who had been too
busy enjoying Harding to bother about costumes,
were the only guests who were not wearing
some sort of fantastic disguise. Bob had
bought a box of paints and made her own
mask, modeling it and her drapery of brown
denim after the imp that the “B. A.’s Abroad”
had given her. Eugenia Ford was a gryphon,&mdash;or
at least Mary Brooks said so,&mdash;with the
most beautiful pair of wings that had ever appeared
at a Harding party. Polly Eastman
was the elephant that sits on the tower of
Notre Dame. Georgia had planned to be the
other half of the elephant, in accordance with
Harding usage in the matter of elephants and
other four-footed creatures. But at the last
minute she discovered that the Notre Dame
elephant wasn’t four-footed.</p>

<p>“Gargoyles never are,” said Lucile wisely&mdash;it
was she who had pointed out the mistake.
“But never mind, Georgia. You can be one
of my two heads. I was going to be a two-headed
beast if I could. Only Vesta White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
changed her mind afterward and wanted to
be an eagle.”</p>

<p>There were other gargoyles, as impossible to
classify as the real ones, and they squatted in
rows on Georgia’s bed and her big window-box,
popped up mysteriously from behind her
desk, or lounged in strange attitudes in her
easy chairs. Bob Parker actually did get up
on the chiffonier, off the edge of which she
hung in such realistic gargoyle style that the
judges, Babbie and Betty, unhesitatingly
awarded her the prize.</p>

<p>“Not a bit fair,” objected young Eugenia,
flapping her beautiful gryphon’s wings disconsolately.
“We should all have looked a lot
grander on chiffoniers.”</p>

<p>“But you weren’t all clever enough to grab
the one there was,” put in Georgia pacifically.</p>

<p>“Having a gargoyle of your own makes you
notice the attitudes more,” declared Bob
proudly. “Never mind, Miss Ford. The
prize is candy, and we’ll pass it around while
we wait for Georgia’s refreshments to materialize.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten your Harding manners,
Bob,” said Betty severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>“No, you don’t any of you act a bit like
alums,” declared a tall junior, taking off her
mask to breathe.</p>

<p>“You lovely thing!” cried Bob, scrambling
down from the chiffonier to give the
appreciative junior first choice of the prize
candy.</p>

<p>And then the gargoyles had a dance and a
parade, and delicious “eats,” on which Georgia
had rashly spent all that was left of her month’s
allowance. And after that, when the five
19&mdash;’s were having the very best time of all,
just sitting around talking and realizing what a
dear, dear place Harding was, it was time to pull
Bob out of her beloved costume and rush for
trains.</p>

<p>Later in the evening the five classmates sat
in the station at the junction, Babe and Betty
waiting to go west, Bob, Babbie and Roberta
bound for New York.</p>

<p>Babbie looked critically at Babe and Betty.
“I shall tell mother that it worked,” she said.
“You went to bed at three, and got up at
seven this morning to go canoeing. You’ve
eaten four meals to-day and as many ices.
You’ve been horseback and trolley-riding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
You’ve made dozens of calls. It’s now ten
p. m., and you’re fresh as the daisies in Oban.
How’s that for the Harding cure?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel exactly as if it was some
June?” demanded Bob. “Not last June,
but a regular June, you know, and we were
all just going home for the summer.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed everybody, and then a
sleepy silence settled upon the group.</p>

<p>“What were those things we had in the
‘Rise of the Drama’ course?” asked Betty
Wales suddenly. “Not intervals, but something
like that.”</p>

<p>“You mean Interludes, don’t you?” asked
Roberta. “They came right after the Moralities.”</p>

<p>Betty nodded. “That’s what this summer
has been&mdash;an Interlude.”</p>

<p>“With Babe for the fascinating heroine,”
put in Babbie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Betty hastily. “And when
I get home to-morrow the real business of life
is going to begin.”</p>

<p>“Act I, Scene I, Life of Betty Wales,
B. A.,” said Roberta. “Doesn’t that sound
serious? But it won’t be. You’ll play tennis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
with Nan, and go to dances with your brother
and other people’s brothers, and amuse that
darling little sister of yours, and be nice to
everybody who needs it, just as you always
have, except that you won’t be home on a
snippy little vacation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so,” said Betty, laughing at
Roberta’s choice of details. “But then I
want to do something that counts, too.”</p>

<p>“You’re always doing things that count,”
Babe declared, giving her a loving little
squeeze.</p>

<p>“That was just fun,” Betty reminded her
for the hundredth time at least.</p>

<p>“But if fun counts, it counts,” declared
Roberta. “Just ask Madeline Ayres if it
doesn’t. If you can make fun out of hard
work, then, according to Madeline, you really
know how to live.”</p>

<p>“But we’re not the working contingent,”
objected Babbie. “K. and Rachel and Helen
are the workers.”</p>

<p>“They are!” breathed Bob indignantly.
“Just try taking care of certain fresh-air
youngsters for two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Or typewriting most particular briefs for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
your most particular father, who always wants
things in a terrific hurry,” added Roberta.</p>

<p>Betty considered. “I’ve helped in little
ways of course, but I never did any one big
thing. I’m going to now, though.”</p>

<p>“Here’s to a winter of hard work!” cried
Babe. “I shall have to sew, and I hate it.”</p>

<p>“But you must make fun out of it all the
same,” Betty told her, with the flash of gay
courage in her eyes that had won over Mr.
Morton. “I shall, no matter what happens,
and whatever we do, think of the fun we’ll
have talking it over when we all get together
again. Oh, is that our train, Babe?” And
with her curls flying and her eyes dancing
with eagerness Betty Wales turned merrily
from her happy summer’s Interlude to “the
real business of life.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
